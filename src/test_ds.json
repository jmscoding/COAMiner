        "author": "The Hacker News",
        "date": "July 08, 2021",
        "text": "\n This week,  PrintNightmare  - Microsoft's Print Spooler vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) was upgraded from a 'Low' criticality to a 'Critical' criticality. \n This is due to a Proof of Concept published on GitHub, which attackers could potentially leverage for gaining access to Domain Controllers. \n As we  reported earlier , Microsoft already released a patch in June 2021, but it wasn't enough to stop exploits. Attackers can still use Print Spooler when connecting remotely. You can find all you need to know about this vulnerability in this article and how you can mitigate it (and you can).  \n Print Spooler in a nutshell:  Print Spooler is Microsoft's service for managing and monitoring files printing. This service is among Microsoft's oldest and has had minimal maintenance updates since it was released.  \n Every Microsoft machine (servers and endpoints) has this feature enabled by default. \n PrintNightmare vulnerability:  As soon as an attacker gains limited user access to a network, he will be able to connect (directly or remotely) to the Print Spooler. Since the Print Spooler has direct access to the kernel, the attacker can use it to gain access to the operating system, run remote code with system privileges, and ultimately attack the Domain Controller. \n Your best option when it comes to mitigating the PrintNightmare vulnerability is to disable the Print Spooler on every server and/or sensitive workstation (such as administrators' workstations, direct internet-facing workstations, and non-printing workstations). \n This is what Dvir Goren's, hardening expert and CTO at  CalCom Software Solutions , suggests as your first move towards mitigation. \n Follow these steps to disable the Print Spooler service on Windows 10: \n \n Open Start. \n Search for PowerShell, right-click on it and select the Run as administrator. \n Type the command and press Enter:  Stop-Service -Name Spooler -Force \n Use this command to prevent the service from starting back up again during restart: Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled \n \n According to Dvir's experience, 90% of servers do not require Print Spooler. It is the default configuration for most of them, so it is usually enabled. As a result, disabling it can solve 90% of your problem and have little impact on production. \n In large and complex infrastructures, it can be challenging to locate where Print Spooler is used. \n Here are a few examples where Print Spooler is required: \n \n When using Citrix services, \n Fax servers, \n Any application requiring virtual or physical printing of PDFs, XPSs, etc. Billing services and wage applications, for example. \n \n Here are a few examples when Print Spooler is not needed but enabled by default: \n \n Domain Controller and Active Directory \u2013 the main risk in this vulnerability can be neutralized by practicing basic cyber hygiene. It makes no sense to have Print Spooler enabled in DCs and AD servers.  \n Member servers such as SQL, File System, and Exchange servers.  \n Machines that do not require printing.  \n \n A few other hardening steps suggested by Dvir for machines dependent on Print Spooler include: \n \n Replace the vulnerable Print Spooler protocol with a non-Microsoft service.  \n By changing 'Allow Print Spooler to accept client connections', you can restrict users' and drivers' access to the Print Spooler to groups that must use it. \n Disable Print Spooler caller in Pre-Windows 2000 compatibility group. \n Make sure that Point and Print is not configured to No Warning \u2013 check registry key SOFTWARE/Policies/Microsoft/Windows NT/Printers/PointAndPrint/NoElevationOnInstall for DWORD value 1 and change it to 0. \n Turn off EnableLUA \u2013 check registry key SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Policies/System/EnableLUA for DWORD value 0 and change it to 1. \n \n Here's what you need to do next to ensure your organization is secure: \n \n Identify where Print Spooler is being used on your network.  \n Map your network to find the machines that must use Print Spooler. \n Disable Print Spooler on machines that do not use it.  \n For machines that require Print Spooler \u2013 configure them in a way to minimize its attack surface.  \n \n Beside this, to find potential evidence of exploitation, you should also monitor Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Admin log entries. There might be entries with error messages that indicate Print Spooler can't load plug-in module DLLs, although this can also happen if an attacker packaged a legitimate DLL that Print Spooler demands. \n The final recommendation from Dvir is to implement these recommendations through  hardening automation tools . Without automation, you will spend countless hours attempting to harden manually and may end up vulnerable or causing systems to go down \n After choosing your course of action, a  Hardening automation tool  will discover where Print Spooler is enabled, where they are actually used, and disable or reconfigure them automatically. \n \n \n \n Found this article interesting?

        "text": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t by \n\t\t\t Paul Ducklin \t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t Details are scarce so far, but Microsoft is  warning Office users  about a bug that\u2019s dubbed  CVE-2021-40444 , and described as  Microsoft MSHTML Remote Code Execution Vulnerability . \n The bug doesn\u2019t have a patch yet, so it\u2019s what\u2019s known as a zero-day, shorthand for \u201cthe Good Guys were zero days ahead of the Bad Guys with a patch for this vulnerability.\u201d \n In other words: the crooks got there first. \n As far as we can tell, the treachery works like this: \n \n You open a booby-trapped Office file from the internet,  either via an email attachment or by downloading a document from a criminal-controlled web link.\n The document includes an ActiveX control  (embedded add-on code) that ought not to have unrestricted access to your computer.\n The ActiveX code activates the Windows MSHTML component,  used for viewing web pages, exploits a bug in it to give itself the same level of control that you yourself would have right from the Windows desktop, and uses it to implant malware of the attacker\u2019s choice.\n \n MSHTML isn\u2019t a full-on browser itself, but it forms the core \u201cweb engine\u201d of Internet Explorer, and can be used on its own to create browsers or browser-like applications that need or want to display HTML files. \n Even though HTML is most closely associated with web browsing, many apps other than browsers find it useful to be able to render and display web content, for example as a convenient and good-looking way to present documentation and help files, or to let users fill in and submit support tickets. \n This \u201cstripped down minibrowser\u201d concept can be found not only on Windows but also on Google\u2019s Android and Apple\u2019s iOS, where the components Blink and WebKit respectively provide the same sort of functionality as MSHTML on Microsoft platforms. Mozilla products such as Firefox and Thunderbird are based on a similar idea, known as Gecko. On iOS, interestingly, Apple not only uses WebKit as the core of its own browser, Safari, but also mandates the use of WebKit in browsers or browser-like apps from all other vendors. That\u2019s why Firefox on iOS is the only version of that product that doesn\u2019t include Gecko \u2013 it has no choice but to use WebKit instead. \n \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      OTHERS STOP AT NOTIFICATION. WE TAKE ACTION\r\n     \r\n     \r\n      Get 24/7 managed threat hunting, detection, and response delivered by\r\n      Sophos experts\r\n     \r\n     \r\n        Learn\u00a0more  \r\n     \r\n   \r\n \n\t\t\t \n HTML isn\u2019t just for browsing \n What this means is that HTML rendering bugs don\u2019t just affect your browser and your browsing activity. \n There are often many different ways for cybercriminals to poke a virtual stick into vulnerabilities in your operating system\u2019s web rendering code, and thereby to probe for exploits, without needing your browser to be open at all. \n Even if there\u2019s a bug that they can\u2019t control closely enough to take over your browser, they may be able to find other applications in which the vulnerability can be abused not only to crash the app, but also to exploit it in order to grab control from it and implant malware. \n That\u2019s what  CVE-2021-40444  seems to do, with the attack being delivered via Office files loaded into Word, Excel and so on, rather than by web pages viewed directly in your browser. \n Although Microsoft no longer recommends the use of Internet Explorer,  saying instead  that \u201ccustomers are encouraged to move to Microsoft Edge\u201d, the features and the flaws of the MSHTML web rendering engine at the heart of Internet Explorer remain part of the operating system itself. \n What to do? \n \n Avoid opening documents you weren\u2019t expecting.  Don\u2019t be tempted to look at content just because an email or a document happens to align with your interests, your line of work, or your current research. That doesn\u2019t prove that the sender actually knows you, or that they can be trusted in any way \u2013 that information is probably publicly available via your work website or your own social media posts.\n Don\u2019t be tempted to break out of Office Protected View.  By default, Office documents received via the internet (whether by email or web) open in a way that prevents active content such as Visual Basic macros and ActiveX controls from running. If you see a yellow bar at the top of the page, warning you that potentially dangerous parts of the document were not activated, resist clicking the  [Enable Content]  button, especially if the text of the document itself \u201cadvises\u201d you to!\n Consider enforcing Protected View permanently for all external content.  System administrators can enforce network-wide settings that prevent anyone from using the  [Enable Content]  option to escape from Protected View in Office. Ideally, you should never need to trust so-called active content in external documents, and you sidestep a wide range of attacks if you prevent yourself from enabling any active content altogether.\n Disable ActiveX controls that use the MSHTML web renderer.  Sysadmins can enforce this with  network-wide registry settings  that stops ActiveX controls that arrive in new documents from working at all, regardless of whether the document is opened in Protected View or not. This forms Microsoft\u2019s official mitigation for the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability.\n Disable the use of ActiveX in Office.  If you don\u2019t need ActiveX in Office at all, get rid of it altogether.\n Keep your eyes peeled for a patch from Microsoft.  Next Tuesday (2021-09-14) is the September 2021 Patch Tuesday date; let\u2019s hope Microsoft gets a full-blown fix ready by or before then!\n \n \n GROUP POLICY SETTINGS AND REGISTRY ENTRIES YOU MAY FIND USEFUL \n 1. To neutralise ActiveX inside Internet Explorer (of which MSHTML forms the core, as explained above), follow the registry modification instructions in Microsoft\u2019s own  Security Update Guide  for CVE-2021-40444. \n Sophos customers who have applied these modifications can use the Sophos Live Discover tool to search their network for computers that  missed out on the mitigation  with a query like this: \n \r\nSELECT name, type, data, datetime(mtime, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') AS registryWriteTime,\r\nCASE\r\n   WHEN data = '3' THEN 'ActiveX set to DISABLED as recommended by Microsoft'\r\n   ELSE 'ActiveX setting does not match the Microsoft recommendation'\r\nEND AS mitigationStatus\r\nFROM registry\r\nWHERE path LIKE 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Zones\\%\\1001' \r\nOR path LIKE 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Zones\\%\\1004'\r\n \n \n 2. In the Windows Group Policy Editor, look for the settings listed below.  \n You can use the  gpedit.msc  app to edit the local Group Policy on a standalone computer, or the  Group Policy Management Console  app if you are managing a Windows domain. \n Note that the VBA settings below (VBA is short for  Visual Basic for Applications , also known as \u201cOffice macro code\u201d) don\u2019t directly help with the CVE-2021-40444 zero-day hole, which relies on ActiveX, but are worth considering as an additional part of your Microsoft Office security posture. \n \r\nUser Configuration > Administrative Templates > \r\n   Microsoft Office 2016 > Security Settings >\r\n      Disable All ActiveX                 <--if you don't need ActiveX\r\n      Disable VBA for Office Applications <--if you can do without document macros\r\n\r\nUser Configuration > Administrative Templates >\r\n   Microsoft Excel 2016 > Excel Options > Security > Trust Center\r\n      Block macros from running in Office files from the internet\r\n\r\nUser Configuration > Administrative Templates >\r\n   Microsoft Excel 2016 > Excel Options > Security > Trust Center\r\n      Block macros from running in Office files from the internet\r\n      \r\nUser Configuration > Administrative Templates >\r\n   Microsoft Powerpoint 2016 > Powerpoint Options > Security > Trust Center\r\n      Block macros from running in Office files from the internet   \r\n\r\nUser Configuration > Administrative Templates >\r\n   Microsoft Word 2016 > Word Options > Security > Trust Center\r\n      Block macros from running in Office files from the internet   \r\n \n To administer the Office settings above via the Group Policy editor, you will need to install the  Administrative Templates for Office 365, Office 2019 and Office 2016 files  from Microsoft, which aren\u2019t installed by default on Windows desktops or servers, even if you have already installed Office itself.  \n Download the above file, extract the contents to your desktop or some other convenient folder, and then copy the contents of the  admx  directory and its subdirectories into  C:\\Windows\\Policy Definitions . \n \n 3. If you want to turn on the  Disable All ActiveX  option on your own computer directly without using  gpedit , and you are comfortable with editing the Windows registry yourself, you can create the following entry: \n \r\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER > SOFTWARE > Policies > Microsoft >   <--these keys should already exist\r\n   office > commmon > security >                        <--use \"New - Key\" to create these nested subkeys                   \r\n      [DWORD] disableallactivex = 1                     <--finally, use \"New - DWORD (32-bit) Value\"\r\n \n \n 4. From  CMD.EXE  (a regular command prompt window), you can use these commands to check and set the relevant registry entry: \n \r\n> reg query HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\office\\common\\security ^\r\n    /v disableallactivex \r\nERROR: The system was unable to find the specified registry key or value.\r\n\r\n> reg add HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\office\\common\\security ^\r\n    /v disableallactivex ^\r\n    /t REG_DWORD /d 1\r\nThe operation completed successfully.\r\n\r\n> reg query HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\office\\common\\security ^\r\n    /v disableallactivex \r\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\office\\common\\security\r\n    disableallactivex    REG_DWORD    0x1\r\n \n \n SOPHOS DETECTION NAMES \n Sophos products, including email, firewall and endpoint protection products, can detect and block this exploit and the malware we\u2019ve seen delivered with it. \n You can search for the following names in your product logs: \n \r\nExp/2140444-A     \r\nTroj/JSExp-W     \r\nTroj/Cabinf-A\r\nTroj/Agent-BHRO\r\nTroj/Agent-BHPO\r\n \n Note that the final malware delivered by the crooks may differ from attack to attack, and note also that the specific  Troj/Agent-*  zombie malware variants listed could be delivered in other ways. \n In other words, an attack with  Exp/2140444-A  wouldn\u2019t inevitably lead to  Troj/Agent-BHRO  or  Troj/Agent-BHPO  on your network, while the presence of  Troj/Agent-BHRO  or  Troj/Agent-BHPO  on their own wouldn\u2019t inevitably imply that the cause was  Exp/2140444-A . \n \n\t\t\t",

        "title": "Enhancing Your SIEM with Retrospective Analysis in Anomali Match",
        "author": "David Leslie",
        "date": "May 30, 2019",
        "text": "Introduction A breach is announced, details are released, and everyone wonders: does my organization have, or has it had, activity associated with the people or methods connected to this breach? Many organizations today can\u2019t \u00a0answer this question, as they can\u2019t perform efficient historical analysis of past events. Anomali Match provides this ability, with no impact to the SIEM. Anomali Match enhances SIEM technologies by extracting the most crucial information from SIEM data and allowing for historical searches of that data in a fraction of the time it would take to perform on a SIEM. While most SIEM solutions perform a critical role in organizations\u2019 security infrastructures, they are generally incapable of deep retrospective analysis. SIEM technologies generally do well with: Collection of raw log data for store-of-record purposes (NIST 800-53) Selective storage and indexing of data for near real-time analysis (and often cold storage for older data) Parsing of data in to fields for near real-time analysis purposes, either by human analysts, correlation rules, anomaly behavior analysis, pattern discovery or some other type of near real-time analysis and detection Matches logged activity to a limited set of basic threat intelligence indicator types such as IP\u2019s or domains Anomali Match, on the other hand: Only processes and stores fields that would be relevant in performing a deep (months or years) historical search Stores and indexes all relevant data for fast and efficient historical searches Links back to original raw logs when available Matches all current and historical log activity to all known relevant indicators, including meaningful contextual threat model data, which includes threat bulletins, incidents, actor profiles, campaigns, TTP\u2019s, and vulnerabilities Why this matters Do we have this? That\u2019s often the first question asked after a breach is publicly announced. As details around the methods and actors involved in a breach are revealed, stockpiled data can be searched to determine if the same activity has occurred internally. Sometimes. But for most organizations relying on traditional SIEM technologies, \u201cstockpiled\u201d data often consists of only the past three or six months of activity. This is a huge problem if the details of the recently-announced breach being investigated actually happened many months ago, or even as far back as a year. But what if a year or more of historical data does exist? That\u2019s great! At least, if the data was actually searchable. Most SIEM deployments store data in hot and cold storage areas, making historical searches over long periods tedious, as some data needs to be moved from cold to available. But what if a year or more of historical data is available and online? That\u2019s great! Unless an analyst needs to begin the search on Friday before leaving work just to get the results by Monday morning. Most SIEM deployments are designed for the near real-time analysis of log data. SOC analysts analyze a stream of data, perform basic searches on recent activity, and draw a conclusion, while correlation rules automatically perform near real-time analysis on the stream. This is the point and purpose of a SIEM, and most SIEM\u2019s do this quite well, but when it comes to searching all data over the previous months and years, it is cumbersome. With Anomali Match, the question can be answered in seconds. \u00a0Anomali Match is purpose-built to collect, store and rapidly retrieve a record of all internally logged activity, allowing analysts to pinpoint activity by known bad entities in a matter of seconds. Useful Things Along with extremely fast and deep historical searching, Anomali Match is also integrated with the world\u2019s largest Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Anomali ThreatStream. This opens the door for Anomali Match to proactively alert, in near real-time, on activity logged to known bad threats, per high fidelity intelligence from ThreatStream. Anomali Match can also integrate vulnerability data from VA tools like Qualys, allowing for risk prioritization that is based on real-world activity (matches). And by leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK framework, Anomali Match provides deep context across strategic intelligence enabling analyst to assess and respond with great efficiency. Also, various sources can be directed to Anomali Match without the need to increase SIEM storage, licensing, processing power or overall budget. Running historical searches over the weekend is a thing of the past with  Anomali Match . As an integral piece of\u00a0 Anomali , your organization will be able to answer past, current and future questions immediately, and accurately. \n",

Your smartphone\nWhy you need this $29 security key\nOn October 24, Tom Burt, Microsoft Corporate Vice President of Customer Security & Trust said in an advisory that the advanced persistent threat (APT) group, of Russian origin, has now pivoted to software and cloud service resellers in order to \"piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers' IT systems.\"\nThe Redmond giant says that Nobelium's latest campaign was spotted in May this year and no less than 140 companies have been targeted, with 14 confirmed cases of compromise. \nNobelium was responsible for the SolarWinds breach, disclosed by Microsoft and FireEye (now known as Mandiant) in December 2020. \nSolarWinds systems were breached and an update for Orion software was poisoned and later deployed to approximately 18,000 customers. \nThe APT then selected a small number of high-profile targets to exploit, including Microsoft, FireEye, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), and the US Treasury.\nAfter the malicious update was pushed through SolarWind's legitimate channels, malware was planted on these systems, including the Sunburst/Solorigate backdoor.\nMicrosoft estimates that the feat may have taken the efforts of up to 1,000 engineers. However, the latest wave of attacks does not appear to make use of any specific vulnerabilities or security flaws; instead, the group is relying on spray-and-pray credential stuffing, phishing, API abuse, and token theft in attempts to obtain account credentials and privileged access to victims' systems.  \nThe new campaign is part of the Russian threat actors' wider activities. Between July 1 and October 19, Microsoft has warned 609 customers of 22,868 hacking attempts, although the company notes that success is in the \"low single digits.\"\nPrior to July 1, Microsoft alerted customers to overall nation-state hacker attack attempts a total of 20,500 times, including a past phishing campaign launched by Nobelium that impersonated USAID. \n\"This recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and [to] establish a mechanism for surveilling -- now or in the future -- targets of interest to the Russian government,\" Microsoft commented. \"Fortunately, we have discovered this campaign during its early stages, and we are sharing these developments to help cloud service resellers, technology providers, and their customers take timely steps to help ensure Nobelium is not more successful.\"\nMicrosoft has informed all impacted vendors and has also released technical guidance outlining how Nobelium attempts to move laterally across networks to reach downstream customers. \nIn a statement, Mandiant SVP and CTO, Charles Carmakal said the firm has investigated multiple cases of suspected Russian cyberattacks, of which supply chain relationships between technology providers and customers have been exploited. \n\"While the SolarWinds supply chain attack involved malicious code inserted in legitimate software, most of this recent intrusion activity has involved leveraging stolen identities and the networks of technology solutions, services, and reseller companies in North America and Europe to ultimately access the environments of organizations that are targeted by the Russian government,\" Carmakal commented.\nPREVIOUS AND RELATED COVERAGE\nTomiris backdoor discovery linked to Sunshuttle, DarkHalo hackers\nMicrosoft warns of current Nobelium phishing campaign impersonating USAID\nMicrosoft warning: This malware creates a 'persistent' backdoor for hackers\nHave a tip?

Then, once a server is compromised, the threat group deploys FoggyWeb \u201cto remotely exfiltrate the configuration database of compromised AD FS servers, decrypted token-signing certificates and token-decryption certificates,\u201d he said, which can be used to penetrate into users\u2019 cloud accounts.\nIn addition to remotely exfiltrating sensitive data, FoggyWeb also achieves persistence and communicates with a a command-and-control (C2) server to receive additional malicious components and execute them, Nafisi added.\nBackdoor Breakdown\nNafisi provides a thorough breakdown of the sophisticated FoggyWeb backdoor, which operates by allowing abuse of the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) token in AD FS, he explained in the post.\n\u201cThe backdoor configures HTTP listeners for actor-defined URIs that mimic the structure of the legitimate URIs used by the target\u2019s AD FS deployment,\u201d Nafisi wrote. \u201cThe custom listeners passively monitor all incoming HTTP GET and POST requests sent to the AD FS server from the intranet/internet and intercept HTTP requests that match the custom URI patterns defined by the actor.\u201d\nAttackers store the malware in an encrypted file called Windows.Data.TimeZones.zh-PH.pri, while the malicious file version.dll acts as a loader. The DLL file leverages the CLR hosting interfaces and APIs to load FoggyWeb, a managed DLL, in the same Application Domain within which legitimate AD FS managed code is executed.\nIn this way, FoggyWeb gains access to the AD FS codebase and resources, including the AD FS configuration database. The malware also inherits AD FS service account permissions that are required to access the AD FS configuration database, Nafisis wrote.\nAdditionally, \u201cbecause FoggyWeb is loaded into the same application domain as the AD FS managed code, it gains programmatical access to the legitimate AD FS classes, methods, properties, fields, objects and components that are subsequently leveraged by FoggyWeb to facilitate its malicious operations,\u201d he added.\nMoreover, FoggyWeb is also AD FS version-agnostic, which means it doesn\u2019t need to keep track of legacy versus modern configuration table names and schemas, named pipe names and other version-dependent properties of AD FS, Nafisi wrote.\nMalware Mitigation\nMicrosoft has notified all customers observed being targeted or compromised by FoggyWeb, as well as included a comprehensive list of compromise indicators in the post.\nThe company also has recommended several mitigation actions for organizations, including: Auditing of on-premises and cloud infrastructure to identify any changes the actor might have made to maintain access; removing user and app access, reviewing configurations for each, and re-issuing new, strong credentials; and using a hardware security module to prevent the exfiltration of sensitive data.\nMicrosoft also is advising that all customers review their AD FS Server configuration and implement whatever changes are needed to secure the systems from attacks.\nTracking a Known Threat Actor\nMicrosoft researchers have been keeping a wary eye on Nobelium since the company got caught up in the SolarWinds attack that was first discovered late last year. They\u2019ve been tracking the threat group\u2019s activity and capabilities, which have expanded as the actors have built and deployed new malware.\nSince the SolarWinds incident, researchers have observed Nobelium steadily building out its arsenal beyond the Sunburst/Solorigate backdoor and Teardrop malware it initially deployed in that attack, which reached tens of thousands of organizations around the globe (though fewer than 100 were selected by the attackers for actual breach and compromise).\nThe group used malware called Raindrop in those follow-on SolarWinds attacks, then later added GoldMax, GoldFinder and Sibot malware for layered persistence to its toolset.\nMicrosoft researchers also identified EnvyScout, BoomBox, NativeZone and VaporRage as four pieces of malware that were used in a Nobelium email-based attack chain earlier this year.\nRule #1 of Linux Security: No cybersecurity solution is viable if you don\u2019t have the basics down.

        "text": "\n A now-patched critical vulnerability in OpenSea, the world's largest non-fungible token ( NFT ) marketplace, could've been abused by malicious actors to drain cryptocurrency funds from a victim by sending a specially-crafted token, opening a new attack vector for exploitation. \n The findings come from cybersecurity firm Check Point Research, which began an investigation into the platform following public reports of stolen cryptocurrency wallets triggered by free airdropped NFTs. The issues were fixed in less than one hour of responsible disclosure on September 26, 2021. \n \n \"Left unpatched, the vulnerabilities could allow hackers to hijack user accounts and steal entire cryptocurrency wallets by crafting malicious NFTs,\" Check Point researchers  said . \n As the name indicates, NFTs are unique digital assets such as photos, videos, audio, and other items that can be sold and traded on the blockchain, using the technology as a certificate of authenticity to establish a verified and public proof of ownership. \n \n The modus operandi of the attack relies on sending victims a malicious NFT that, when clicked, results in a scenario whereby rogue transactions can be facilitated through a third-party wallet provider simply by providing a wallet signature to connect their wallets and perform actions on the targets' behalf. \"Users should be hyper-aware of what they sign on OpenSea, as well as other NFT platforms, and whether it correlates with expected actions,\" the researchers said. \n \n OpenSea said it hasn't identified any instances where this vulnerability was exploited in the wild but added it's working with third-party wallet services to \"help users better identify malicious signature requests, as well as other initiatives to help users thwart scams and phishing attacks with greater efficacy.\" \n \"Blockchain innovation is fast-underway and NFTs are here to stay. Given the sheer pace of innovation, there is an inherent challenge in securely integrating software applications and crypto markets,\" said Oded Vanunu, head of products vulnerabilities research at Check Point. \"Bad actors know they have an open window right now to take advantage of, with consumer adoption spiking, while security measures in this space still need to catch up.\" \n \n \n \n Found this article interesting?

        "date": "April 19, 2021 | ",
        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t With 5G, edge solutions, and digital transformation all around us, every enterprise should be taking a closer look at their endpoint security and evaluate options that will be able to keep pace with this dynamic new environment.The newly introduced\u00a0\u00a0AT&T Managed Endpoint Security with SentinelOne\u2122\u00a0offer brings world class managed services with comprehensive endpoint security. \n\n SentinelOne brings best-of-breed Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) with deep integration into the AT&T Unified Security Management (USM) platform and Alien Labs Open Threat Exchange (OTX). This deep integration, along with AT&T\u2019s 500+ partner integrations, can provide businesses Extended Detection and Response (XDR) capabilities from the endpoint to the network to the cloud. Plus, through the AT&T Security Operations Center, businesses can rely on world class monitoring and management of their endpoints. \n\n Here are the unique benefits it can bring to enterprises: \n\n Industry leading technology \n\n Joining forces with the best of the best is crucial especially when it comes to endpoint security. AT&T has teamed up with SentinelOne who provides next-generation endpoint security combining antivirus, EPP, and EDR into one agent. SentinelOne has been highly recognized in the industry and was number 1 in the  2020 MITRE ATT&CK test - APT 29  for most total detections and most correlated alerts through comprehensive storyline technology. \n\n This autonomous agent utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to help protect against known and unknown threats and eliminates reliance on external factors for protection. This faster, \u201cmachine-speed\u201d detection & response provides continuous protection, even when offline. And, in the event of an attack, the SentinelOne agent can perform 1-click remediation and rollback with no custom scripting or re-imaging required. \n\n Deep integration with AT&T\u2019s USM platform and Alien Labs OTX \n\n AT&T Cybersecurity and SentinelOne bring one of the most unique combinations in the market via the deep integrations between the SentinelOne platform and the AT&T USM platform. This deep integration allows for orchestrated and automated incident response on the endpoints. \n\n Additionally, deep integrations were built between the world\u2019s largest open threat intelligence community, AT&T Alien Labs Open Threat Exchange (OTX), and the SentinelOne agent. The AT&T Alien Labs OTX encompasses over 145,000 security professionals submitting over 20 million threat indicators per day. Additional context is provided from the USM sensor network with an additional 20 million threat observations per day and AT&T\u2019s Chief Security Office analyzing over 446 PB of traffic from 200 countries and territories. By correlating the incidents of compromise from AT&T Alien Labs OTX, AT&T is able to deliver added context that allows for faster responses. These same AT&T Alien Labs detections and threat intelligence also informs threat hunting on SentinelOne\u2019s EDR data to help yield richer insights and easier detection of evasive threats. \n\n Expert management \n\n As  one of the world's top MSSPs , AT&T Cybersecurity employs highly experienced and industry certified individuals for the Managed Endpoint Security with SentinelOne offering. AT&T brings over 25 years of experience in delivering managed security services and knows what it takes to keep pace with the dynamic threat landscape. To stay ahead, AT&T\u2019s security analysts maintain security certifications including GSE, CISSP, CEH, and more.\u00a0 \n\n For the Managed Endpoint Security with SentinelOne offering, AT&T provides high touch service delivery through platform onboarding, initial policy tuning, and training. Most importantly though, AT&T helps the customer build a custom incident response plan (IRP). This IRP will be the blueprint for how to respond to an incident and the importance of this plan cannot be understated. In fact, in Ponemon\u2019s\u00a0 Cost of a Data Breach Report , they compared organizations who had an IRP versus those that did not and found that those with a plan reported less breach-related costs by an average of $2 million. AT&T will help with this IRP and meet regularly to adjust this plan based on new threat intelligence. \n\n Finally, AT&T\u2019s Security Operations Center will provide continuous monitoring, management and support for the Managed Endpoint Security with SentinelOne offering. This includes 24x7x365 eyes on glass to review and triage alarms as well as investigate and respond to threats. This helps alleviate the burden of keeping up with threats and helps reduce the risk of a compromise. With this added team of experts, security staff can be redeployed towards other important security functions and help overcome the cyber-skills shortage. \n\n Cohesive managed solutions \n\n This new offering, with its deep integrations, helps customers on their journey to XDR. Through the AT&T USM platform, AT&T is able to manage multiple AT&T offers for even greater protection. AT&T utilizes the same SOC analyst team to monitor and manage these two distinct threat detection technology stacks. This extends alert correlation across the organization\u2019s network to add context, provide better detection, and orchestrate response. This single point of contact for both solutions simplifies the experience and helps further enable XDR. \n\n Trusted advisors \n\n A trusted advisor can help customers proactively identify areas of cyber risk and take preventive measures to help protect critical assets. AT&T Cybersecurity can help with design, service delivery, and management of end to end security- from the endpoint to the network to the cloud.\u00a0 \n\n An experienced and vigilant managed security services provider can help detect cyber threats early, and provide coordinated defenses for fast and effective response, helping to mitigate impact to the business. Through the AT&T Managed Endpoint Security with SentinelOne offer, enterprises can reduce the cost and complexity of protecting their endpoints and be prepared to adapt and scale as the business takes on digital transformation. \n\n AT&T Cybersecurity is extremely excited to introduce the new  Managed Endpoint Security with SentinelOne .\u00a0 Please reach out to us for more information on this groundbreaking new service offering. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

        "text": "\n \n The Canadian province\u00a0of Newfoundland and Labrador has suffered a cyberattack that has led to severe disruption to healthcare providers and hospitals. \n The attack took place on October 30th, causing regional health systems to shut down their networks and cancel thousands of medical appointments. This outage affected health systems in Central Health, Eastern Health, Western Health, and the Labrador-Grenfell Regional Health authorities. \n \n The IT outage also affected communications in the region, with people reporting an inability to reach the health care centers or 911 via phone. \n Yesterday, the Department of Health and Community Services announced that they had started an investigation into the systems outage with the help of the managed service provider, Bell Aliant. \n Returning to pen and paper \n As emails are not working and doctors cannot register new patients or upload and access medical results on the database, many affected health centers have turned to using pen and paper. \n Affected healthcare centers have also been forced to cancel or reschedule appointments for chemotherapy, x-ray scans, surgeries, and other specialist services. \n While the IT outages are not the same for all hospitals in the province, almost all of them deal with\u00a0 some form of disruption . \n The only thing that continues to operate normally are vaccinations, emergency care, and the admission of cases that can't be rejected. \n Likely a ransomware attack \n While the Canadian government or healthcare systems have not disclosed what type of cyberattack they have suffered, sources have told BleepingComputer that it is ransomware. \n Health Minister John Haggie and Eastern Health CEO David Diamond spoke at a media conference earlier today, stating that the incident had a 'significant impact' and a 'damaged data center.'\u00a0 \n \n If this turns out to be a ransomware attack, there is a good chance that data was stolen as well, including possible patient information. \n As for when things will return to normal status, Haggie said it could be a couple of days before all systems are up and running again. \n BleepingComputer has contacted the province's press contact with further questions but has not heard back at this time. \n Canada in hackers\u2019 crosshairs \n Canada's public services have been a target for numerous ransomware attacks in the past. \n In October 2020, Montreal's STM public transport system was\u00a0 hit by RansomExx , and in December 2020, Vancouver's Metro operator TransLink faced severe IT problems following\u00a0 an Egregor attack . \n A month later, TransLink concluded its investigation and confirmed that the Russian hackers had stolen customer details. \n \n Related Articles: \n Moses Staff hackers wreak havoc on Israeli orgs with ransomless encryptions Microsoft warns of the evolution of six Iranian hacking groups MediaMarkt hit by Hive ransomware, initial $240 million ransom Second farming cooperative shut down by ransomware this week Hacking gang creates fake firm to hire pentesters for ransomware attacks \n \n",
